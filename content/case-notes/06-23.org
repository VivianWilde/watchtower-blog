* TIFU by Letting my +Bestie+ Trusted Colleague Get Captured By a Capitalist [BLEEP]
** Notes on the basement walls
- Several inconsistencies
- 21 days: "The End?", "TIMEOUT",
- NOTE: "The end", "worried about the franchise" was in the book club
- “What do they want”
- Chrono: Holly TL -> Power
- Knight: End of HEMLOCK
- Watcher: Our fail -> End of us
- SH: Stop the end
- HEMLOCK: Fight the Fight
- TIMEOUT: The End of Everything
- Oh, timeout, those mysterious guys.
*** Computer
- It's way too old to be hacked by Enigma
- Password: "takes a minute"
- More details about the moon mining
- Time Wikipedia: Last Resort (article is private), overlooking a lake.
- Files on two watchers: Jane Doe and Larry Morton have been pulled up, both heavily redacted
- Chat log: (To Mildred) "Wait for me. Found something. Talking to detective shortly". From Uncle Benny, about 6:10 on Tasha's deathday.
**** Leads on Holly
- Mines have been on for way too long, with too little area, for there to be as many resources.
- So most likely, some shady/undocumented reserve somewhere. This checks out.
- Mining: Did ChronoCo take down Last Resort for mining ops?
**** Last Resort
- "The Last Resort and Spa"
- Heavily restricted
- Neither of us have access to the place, but we can sneak access illegally by forging credential
- Lake Tahoe, ~2430. We have special coords for it, normally inaccessible
- Enigma has the coordinates
*** Clay Doll
- (Info from Rosemary)
- European
- Probably Italian (possibly France)
- Doll/toy/trinket
- 200BC to 300AD, Naples Italy.
- Pompeii
- Part of a set that connects together
*** Mysterious Notes In Kaleidoscopic Invisible Ink
- Dusty fingerprints (dust from a different time), as if from someone who just got back from a jump
- Pompeii?
- Submarine blueprint
- Article: Mining on the moon, references to Holly are highlighted
- "New forms of chronite fuel for time fluid", "New reserves"
- Question: Where are the reserves, what are the other things the new fluid can do.

*** Other side of the wall
- Commonly used, someone time-travelled there a lot
** Moon Mines
- Ruse: Talk to Stockton about environmental impacts and sustainable moon-mining
- Markefacts: He's jut bullshitting about things being "biodegradable and digestable"
- Refining process happens elsewhere at the facility
- New refinement process: "Better way to get fuel".
- No abnormal radiation, etc. here
- No real effect on the /surrounding/ Lunar geology/ecosystem/etc.
- Refining process seems suspicious
- He's not entirely lying! There is no environmental impact from this.
- High yield and low environmental impact are true, but there's something sketchy afoot with not just the refinement process, but something else.
- Mining: Chronite is main, some secondary stuff - nickel, etc.
*** Sneaking About
- Magpie went on ahead, then the watcher squad
- We have life signs, nothing too suspicious on Enigma and Miri's temporal vision
- Conjecture: Double-dipping from the moon. So taking resources from different time periods.
- It disagrees with the video of the trash-heap earth.
*** Birds-Eye View
- Ops are underground
- Crater to descend
- Mining elevator
- Not many points of entry from above
- Magpie went to the refinery
*** Refinery
- Purple liquid flowing in
- People in light spacesuits loading stuff
- Foreman and offices
- On the face of it, nothing weird.
- Not an exceptional excess of fluid.
- So stuff going into the refinery
*** Shaft
- Sounds of machinery and a few stray pickaxes down to the left
- "New shipment in, helps we have some extra employees, all reporting to that sublevel"
- "We're getting the produce, maybe that's what they're keeping down there"
- "Holly's stopping by, apparently" <Some bitching about Ross>
- 11th floor needed a key, we picked the lock
** Secret 11th Sublevel
- Executive Offices
- Man sitting at a desk, smiles at us, and then reaches for something.
- We knocked him out before he could trigger an alarm
- Doctors Office, Lab, Experimental Refinery
- Timeline Room. Hmm.
*** Timeline Room
- Pope-looking guy shows an ID card, proceeds, walks into a little chamber where the floor is a bronze disk, guard pulls a lever, and he disappears
- Almost certainly an illicit time-jumping facility
- From the special abilities: The chamber is another Auxiliary Time Engine
- Transporting someone/something from a different /timeline/
- Sending people from prime timeline to interfere with an alternate timeline
- Mining operations on an alternate earth!
*** Labs
- Time tech, Zephyr style
- Modified time capsule.
- Capsules: Transport things (not people) throughout time
- Crawling with people, both scientists and guards
*** Refinery
- Vast
- Giant time capsules
- Kaleidoscope: Capsules periodically open, purple-ish stuff falls through. So definitely pulling resources from another timeline.
- Fuck Enigma got captured
*** Soft Hands (Potential Suspects)
- Paladin Glass (spelling ?)
- Cleric Orlaith
- Cleric Hadvar
- Damien ???
