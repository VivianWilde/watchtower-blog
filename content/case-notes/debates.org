- First time I'm hearing the clown's voice. Exciting.
- Good to put a voice to the name
- What's Breacher up to?
- Three seats. Interesting
- Shoutout to everyone's improv abilities, you all are good at this
- "Mysteriously British Watcher" was referenced at some point, and Marlow's speech is so British. "Scuffle". Marlow: Hawkish but sane.
- Why is the clown making sense? I don't like this.
- Damien: "At least two" councillors removed. That's a choice of words, what do you know?
- Woo, it's Breacher
- Ok, why is the hemlock mouthpiece the most sensible person here?
- Ok now we know why at least.
- Hang on why is Damien making sense?
- Marlow: Good plans for council transparency, Morgana supports. Whew, I worried this was going to be a problem.
- How did Mr Time get the video of Damien? Oh, from AC. Right. Duh.
- But wasn't AC with us at the time? What kind of range does their camera have?
- They have cloaking, is this related to that? This feels concerning.
- AC: "I love you like a brother"
- AC literally two minutes later: "As an automaton... I have no emotions, I have no bias"
- Ah, Breacher, I love you.
