** Timeline (new entries)
- 9:30-12: Council Meeting
- 12:30: Tasha visited Alec
- ~12:30: Tasha got a text from Alex saying "I'll kill you if you tell anyone about this", but previous messages are very chill. So text might be a ruse???
- 1:30: Tasha working at the union office
- 3:30 Emergency Meeting: Tasha, Clinton, Doe, Tuhorn, and a full list of others were late and the Lone Master sent a rep.
** Tasha
- Alec mentioned Tasha had been acting strange recently
- Alec: "Tasha knew something before she died."
- Tasha had been frantic recently, terrified, not her usual optimistic self. Talking to shady figures (shady by Alec standards). For the past few weeks.
- Been running back to her estate mid-day, even missing meetings for it.
- Tasha ostensibly never jumped, recently started asking Alec about time tech and trying to acquire a watch (about a month ago)
- Potential Lead: Alec put Tasha in touch with some contact about acquiring a watch.
- She's been in the knights district frequently.
- Potential Lead: Clinton and Tasha had a lot to discuss, and Tasha was raising eyebrows at Clinton in the council meeting on her deathday.
- (Probably nothing) Tasha was really into "Moon Detective", a bad scifi detective TV show from the 50s.
** Estate
- Holly wanted to buy the estate, pissed that Miri has it
- Library: Political structure of the watchtower, and books from across time.
- Library: Dr Zephyrs books "The Trouble with T.I.M.E" about timeline ruptures and stabilisation, and "Living your next life: Quasi-temporal revivification". (NOTE: Jane Doe heard a revivification talk in the council, did not like it, for unspecified reasons)
- Crest in the wall behind the library.
- Golden key on the coffee table, don't know what it unlocks.
- Two bedrooms, both in use recently. So Tasha was living with someone.
** Journal
- I don't have enough time. I need to find it before they do.
- Selene should know, she's told me so much.
- As long as I can get to the other time I can figure out.
  "There's no receptacle though, it can't be used".
- I feel like I'm going crazy
- The fact that nobody knows makes them the crazy one.
- "Worried about Madame E and Selene. Don't know if I can trust them. But I need to know"
- "I think it's Holly. Something about that mining operation. She's been hiding something from the whole council. Another timeline?"
- She's not just mining for time fluid.
** Corkboard
- Found in Tasha's office
- Rosemary, Holly, Frog, some businessman, and some mysterious armored figure in the chronoCo column.
- Frog: "Lost in transit", Armed figure: "Tester"
- Thorwald elsewhere crossed out, "knows about it" (that is also crossed out), "useful idiot"
- ?? over a blue tab (watchers?), pictures of Lone Master, Jane Doe, and Whisperer and the British cane dude (Marlow)
- Trashcan has pictures of Madame E and Selene.

** Letter
- The letter is carefully not frantic, unlike the journal entries from the same time.
*** Invisible Ink
- Triplets of numbers, in the form ~(page, line, char)~.
- Book key at the top. "Time War"
- Actual message: From Tasha: "Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp."
- Adress: "Aunt Mildred", some time-hopping contact. Addressed to Pompeii
** Computer
- Holly ghosted Tasha's attempts to fish for information
- Small message group ("book club"), exchanged book names, possibly a way to share message keys.
- Mentions of "the end, the storm", ostensibly film. Someone "worried about the franchise"
- Tasha asked Holly for support on making minutemen official faction
- Someone (her contact in Pompeii) visited 2 months ago.
- 3 watchtower agents implicated in this. We have their contacts, need to trace them. Scarred man was probably one of them.
** Desk
Stuff we found in a locked desk drawer. The drawer was booby-trapped with a poison dart, and caught fire once opened.
*** Film (Collection of disconnected scenes)
- People bowing to a giant gold chronoCo logo and Holly Holland walking out
- Mining operations on Earth, probably an alternate-timeline or historical earth. This earth looks less polluted/trashed than ours. Different infrastructure - the mining looks like an entire mining "district". Looks like it was built anew, rather than on top of an existing city. Looks like it was built to be a mining operation and has been solely a mining operation for a while.
- Desert: Bombed/fallout vibes. Building and a pool are the only nice features, and a towel saying "LRS" (NOTE: Tasha had an LRS handkerchief)
- Blue haired middle-aged man: Roughly matches the description of Malachai von Spatz, from the lore. Perhaps a relative or younger version, but perhaps not. Might be an alternate-timeline version of him, but that's unlikely.
- Final shot: Icy background, someone looking for something. Right: Orange haired 18 year old waving at camera, points to a tetrahedron.
*** Letters Archive
- To Tasha: "The Last Resort. Enemy of my Enemy. Hall not here." Weeks/months ago
- To Tasha: "Stealing the Truth, three thirty. Time Man Helping. Distract. Knight Facts Needed." Recent, close to death day
- From Tasha: "Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp." Recent, unsent
- We found a receptacle manual
- Burned letters: One dates to a year ago.
- "Time Man helping". And we have a "Mr TIME"
** Councillors (We talked to Holly and Jane)
- Purple scarman stole the data
- Working for Secondhand Revolution
- So Tasha probably was as well
- Original scarman died, Jane wants to talk to ours.
*** Council Meeting
- Tasha was in the 930-12 council meeting.
- Tasha defended accepting time refugee. Holland opposes
- Zephyr gave a speech on revivification
- Tasha argued for making the minutemen official
- Some talk about automatons, and updates from knight commander.
