title: Anyway, I Believe You Were Tracking a Snail Using Narcotics
---
* Hello Juniper
- Spaceship is a trap. "Ship shall be the Second's grave"
- We got pocketwatches from Dalton
- 15 trips to take stuff to the SecondHand
- Breacher is Frida Aleman because of course she fucking is
- She did some receptacle bullshit
- We accidentally built the same characters
* Snail
- Snail's shell structure is spiraled/structured chronite.
- It blips between timelines and eras, but is still very stable
* Carboniferous era
- Bullet hole in the trees
- Some kind of rifle, futuristic (so 2100 or later, thereabouts)
- Something large has been dragged along the floor to the west
- Some sort of armored arthropod has been dragged: A big centipede according to Phoenix
- Last person here: Fired a gun shot, steampunk pith helmet, shot a centipede and dragged it off.
- Looks like one guy, not an industrial operation
* Hunter: Cormac
- "Did Shay give you these coordinates"
- Who is Shay?
- "These were supposed to be private coordinates"
- He's getting ancient meat for rich ChronoCo people
- Dr. Lightborn is hunting for the snail as well.
- Has a letter from Lightborn, wants the snail for research. Honestly I'd love to give it to her but we need it more.
- Mr. TIME asked for the snail for modifications to his displacement gun
- Something like Enigma's time sense would be useful in finding the snail
- A scientist on the mission has a device that could find the snail
* Tracking
- Another confrontation - a smaller insect was netted, like one of the giant dragonflies
- Blue dust on the ground
- Not residue, it's the end product of some factory procedure
- A potent chemical
- It's a drug
- Possibly one that lets you grab views of a different timeline
- A scientist moving quietly, she's seriously hunting the snail
- There's 4 people, 1 is a scientist
- One has a taser and a weird watch. Presumably designed to capture the snail
- Lightborn's nerds got alerted
- Snail eats minerals, including a few specific ones
- Snail's current reality: Snail "looks up", seems to sense you
- The snail can see you in this drug-induced state
* Snail
- Sydney is one who "wanders the in-between"
-
* Researchers
- We killed all the Lightborn people
* Tasks
- Watchers have plans for stuff at the ball
- MacIntyre's keeping knights from killing each other
- Phoenix will be there
