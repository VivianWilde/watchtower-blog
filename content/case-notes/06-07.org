* <2024-06-07 Friday> The Murder of Tasha Tennyson
Notes taken and published from the case files of Enigma, my respected colleague in Watchery, mystery-solving, and sharpshooting.
** The Heist Theft
- Confidential information was stolen from the Watchtower, prompting all factions to scurry in a race to retrieve it before anything got leaked; though we are working together, all factions have their own agendas...
- It is suspected that an unknown scarred man was behind the theft and is related to the shooting of Tasha Tennyson
** Watchtower Shooting Background
- Minutemen faction leader and Councilor Tasha Tennyson was murdered while most of us were off on our missions, supposedly by Watcher Inspector Seline (who is M.I.A.)
- Watcher leader and Councilor Madame E. who was present around the murder is currently M.I.A.
- Chrono-Co Councilor Holly Holland was witness to the shooting
- Certain accounts recall Inspector Seline last seen slipping through the Central Time Engine (CTE)
** Investigations Notes
- Miri was summoned by her sister, Inspector Seline, sometime before the murder took place and Seline’s disappearance
- Seline was a protege of Madame E.
- Tasha was a respected Councilor despite the Minutemen's disputed status as a faction
- The Egypt group were the only people who traveled through the CTE between the time windows of when the murder happened
- A guard recalls Seline walked into the Council Chamber a bit after Tasha, just before the killing
- Barney (CTE doorman) says he never saw Seline use the CTE despite claims that she did so to escape
- Councilor Galloway recalls that you can’t hop through Watchtowers using watches (blocked by design), at least that he knows of
- Councilor Jane Doe may have had access to the Watchtower information that was stolen
** Security Footage
- Footage showed Seline entering the premises as normal; the security guards recognized her and she was granted access
- Seline didn’t go to the CTE but towards the Minutemen markets (which houses the Minutemen HQ, black markets, and a Receptacle den)
** Accounts from Holly Holland
- Holly saw that the murderer was a woman in blue attire with purple hair, though she did not get a clear look at the face
- Holly witnessed the murderer face Tasha, who had something like a capsule or spyglass outstretched in her hand, and shoot Tasha before picking up what she was holding and running off
- The gun used in the murder was a handgun; Holly recommended going to Regina, a gun expert, for further details
** Accounts from the Cloaked Wizard
- Tasha had many friends and many enemies
- Someone wanted to mess with Tasha’s “people”
- Tasha “played a game, but lost 2-22”
- Councilors Jane Doe and Tilda Clinton were elected but the third Chrono-Co is unknown; “Dalton will settle the score"
** Cold Case
- Visions of Tasha showed her confused and desperately pleading, saying “please Seline” over and over
- The murderer showed visible signs of hesitancy (hand shaking, mutterings of “I don’t want to do this”, etc)
- Other conversations with Tasha in them shows her speaking of  “the end” and other cryptic allusions
- Councilor Rachel Anderson spoke of “beasts of steel” during a past chamber meeting
** Accounts from Alec Wilde
- Wilde states that though he didn't particularly like her, Tasha was like family and he was dedicated to protecting her
- The Knights didn’t seem to like Tasha
- Tasha spoke highly of Tilda Clinton
- Wilde believes a Councilor was part of the theft at the Watchtower, as some of the information that was stolen was so confidential it wasn’t even in the public Archives
- The other general documents that were stolen were encrypted and shipped away
- Wilde suspects the theft was a distraction for something much greater
** Will Reading
- Tasha’s financial assets were to be used towards aid and relief for temporal refugees
- Selene was willed an estate, but in the absence of Selene being able to claim her inheritance, the portion would be passed to her sister Miri
- A sweatshirt for Councilor Clinton
- A sculpture of a frog for Councilor Tuhorn of the Forest
- A regular watch for Councilor Anderson
