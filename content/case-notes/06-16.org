* <2024-06-16 Sun>A Chimpanzee, A Hologram, and A Magpie Walk Into A Bar...
** Breacher
- Found the keys to Tasha's code
- Last Resort: Place in Tahoe
- Running for the council, as is Mr Time.
- Book club: Mildred, Benny, Tasha, Cousin Riley
- Didn't find the journal, interesting
** Dr Rain
- Jake Robertson
- Political opinions
- "Making a change"
- "I guess that's what happens to you after you get a PhD and realize it wasn't worth anything..."
*** Zephyr Convo
- Jake: Sent by Lightborn (ChronoCo) or Tuhorn. Or maybe Clinton??
- Lightborn is a good scientist with delusions of grandeur
- Robertson's days at university: Part of radical club. "Freedom of the Watchtower", secondhand recruitment funnel.
- Club still exists
- Theft: We don't know what.
- Thinks Robertson was manipulated
** House (infinite in its kindness)
- Miri has a token to unlock the crest in the library.
- We found a secret passage in the library, classic
- Keep in mind, this is all accessed via a coin from Selene's stuff.
- So either this is /for Selene to access/ or alternatively
*** Vault Door
- 6 digit code, we did not crack.
*** Notes
- "21 days"
- Under that: "last resort, destruction, war, trial, paradox, conspiracy?".
- Pompeii
- Submersible diagram "under the lake"
- Picture of young/parallel/??? Malachai petting a dog
*** Chess
- Chess board, missing one of the white knights.
- The remaining knight is a horse with six legs.
- NOTE: Breacher has seen the six-legged knight before, but Bryce (OOC) cannot recall where.
- Position is normal setup, but pawn to e4 has happened
*** Receptacle Tank
- Receptacle tank: the thing you step in to bodyswap
- Receptacle tank: Should theoretically work. But it shouldn't! The watchtower should be temporally locked aside from the Central Engine
- So this is a place to do bodyswaps without being logged by the central watchtower. But this one doesn't let you bodyswap with someone in the tower.
*** Auxiliary Time Engine
- Big bronze disk, 1 foot radius
- Bronze disk: Walking near it makes you feel lighter
- Faint purple cylindrical glow - temporal energy?
- The disk is NOT quite temporally locked. So this is a miniature self-contained auxiliary time engine
- Receptacle was being used by Tasha. Perhaps to check out Last Resort.
- Someone jumped in 3 hours after Tasha's death. Plausibly Selene
- Minutemen markets are on the way here.
- So Selene probably went by the Auxiliary Engine!
- Doll made of white clay, laid at the foot of the bronze circle. Robed, not Franciscan monk
- Object: From a distant past era, taken out of time to the watchtower. So very little wear and tear, but very old.
**** Plan
- Question: Could you receptacle into someone, say 3 days ago outside the watchtower, and then that body enters the watchtower (via either time-travelling their body in, or just physically walking in)
- Say, by using the auxiliary time engine to beam in?
** Interrogation
- Less bruised than Greeceman
- Pristine - no blemishes other than the big ugly scar (resurrected)
- Nervous, not in control
- "I was dead. There was a clown"
- He was looking for someone. It was important. That's his oldest memory
- "Then I was dead". Chased down by a robot, a detective.
- Killer was talking about their wife killed by the Mafia
- Scarman thinks he died in Florence, but we know he was alive when he was brought here. He died from strangulation.
- Cold case insights: Knight officer, gold, soft hands
- Jake Robertson was the "tester" on Tasha's chart. Perhaps testing revivification
- Frog: "Lost in transit"
- Thorwald: Useful idiot
*** Breacher
- Rosemary insight: We can trust her as far as someone with good hardiness can throw her, which is not amazing but hey for a ChronoCo employee that's better than I expected.
- No reason to distrust her on this thing, but why she's on the board is still a mystery.
** Stakeout!
- Someone in a grey trench coat and hat.
- Furtive, going to the PO box to pick up the thing
- Veiled face, trenchcoat, gloves.
- They are spooked, but don't seem to have
- Path: Leisurely, not circuitous.
- Walking strangely, bent over like a hunchback
- Hiding something, or wounded?
- Goes to providence park and sits at a table
- It's one person in a coat, but they sit weirdly - like they're hiding something.
- Shoes: Don't fit right. They don't have human feet! It's like they're holding the shoes with their feet. Apparently their feet are hand-like, and gripping the shoe.
- TODO: Acquire a 1d16
- From Sidney: It's a big chimpanzee of some kind
- Tuhorn works with animals a lot. Hm.
- Veiled. The Chimpanzee is in mourning for someone. /j
*** Bird convo
- "The bread man comes all the time"
- No regular schedule (per the birds)
- Meets with people in business suits.
- Business suit people do not like birds, but the "bread man" (chimp) always feeds the birds.
- Chimp is their favorite bread man.
- He always goes, he comes back carrying something, and has us (birds) carry it off.
- Birds go somewhere and sit there. So some kind of signalling
- Different birds have different "destinations".
- "Other treats"
- Four crows, chimp dispatches them to their destinations at different times as some kind
- NB: Last time we had a total of 4 book club members, counting Tasha. Nice.
- "brown cloaks" and "science types" speak to the birds.
- Science types: Robertson?? Nope, just fieldwork grad students.
- Tuhorn has talked to this crow before.
-
*** Shadowing the Chimp
- "The Drunken Duckling" bar.
- Chimp is onto us. Sneaks out a back door, moving quickly to the Central Time Engine
- Chimp jumped into a different time
- Barney shook his head, and then went back to paperwork
- "Pete?" Classified, according to Barney
- Talk to Watcher command
- Some unknown councillor gave the order. The chimp is one of Tuhorn's.
