# Last Goodbye

Enigma catches Morgana before they can slip away to destroy the destabilisers, and tries to dissuade them. It doesn’t change anything.

For the sake of clarity, I’m just going to consistently use they/them for Morgana and she/her for Enigma so that we don’t have to wrangle referents of pronouns  
I will be doing over-the-top amounts of angst, I apologise

## Morgana

Simon laughs as he waves his robot arm (and not-quite robot-hand) at Morgana and shouts “Reattached limb buddies\!”, before going in for a clumsy high five. Morgana laughs along with him \- Simon’s enthusiasm is infectious, and god knows they need a laugh after hearing about Breacher.  
Their laugh cuts off abruptly as Simon asks “So, how’d you lose your hand anyway?”  
Their eyes drift over to Enigma, wistful at first and then cold. Finally they respond “... Bad choices. Long story”, and even Simon picks up on the implicit “drop it”.  
Morgana’s silent after that, staring at their datapad. Their eyes are focused like they’re trying to puzzle something out, but if anyone were to look at the screen they’d see a photo of Morgan’s bandaged hand raising an ice-cream cone, as if in some kind of toast.

They’re still scrolling through their photos when they get a message from Magpie \- “one machine down, two left”. Morgana hesitates for a moment and dashes off a quick response “hang back. Coming to reinforce. Trying to sneak away from the watcher”  
There’s a few opportunities where the group is distracted chasing Holly and they’re almost able to make their escape, but ~~Enigma~~ the watcher keeps looking over at them.  
Eventually they come to a fork in the tunnels, and ~~Enigma~~  the watcher’s busy trying to trace Holly with her time-sense while Simon sends his hand to scout ahead.  
Morgana gives Tracker a quick “shush” gesture and begins to backtrack through the tunnels.   
Before they recede out of sight, they turn back to the group and mouth something under their breath, more for themself than for anyone listening… And that’s when they notice Enigma staring right at them while the rest of the team disappears down a tunnel.  
Their hand falls to their holster as they wait for her to draw a gun or signal Larry, but to their surprise she just begins to slowly walk towards them.
