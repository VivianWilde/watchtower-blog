# Memories in the cold-case

I amped cold-case so that it conveys subjective impressions as well as just events. This is most certainly not a copout so that I can avoid having to follow the "show, don't tell" maxim. Canonically, the thing that decided Morgana's break from the watchers was her imagining Miri dying as an 18 year old and swearing that she'd die rather than stand by and let that happen (and die she did)

## Enigma
- Eye-rolling at the knights together
- Bouncy Castle night
- Ice-cream after we got the bomb out
- Dragging you to an ice-cream celebration with ace squad
- A timelapse of getting punched by Enigma, and Morgana getting better and better at interpreting them as affection
- The shared moment of "Simon what the fuck" with you in Holland's timeline, and then just Morgana missing you terribly.
- Hanging out in Izzy's apartment when she mentioned the "one of us might have to die" part of the plan, and Morgana privately resolving "whatever happens it won't be Enigma"
- Izzy's house again - seeing you tolerating the cats despite yourself

### How Morgana sees them

- Abstractly, she's a bit of a mess but Morgana loves her so dearly

## Breacher

- Everytime Breacher posited "maybe ___ is future you or me" and Morgana religiously filed that away
- Putting the pieces together

### How Morgana sees them

- She looked up to Breacher so much

## Rosemary

Watching you lock down 1/3 of a pirate fleet with contract negotiations  

Recommending you to Izzy for the "kill Paradox" squad, and being completely certain you could do it  
A scene of

- Hearing from Izzy about how you nuked Paradox
- When Holly Holland pointed a gun at you and Morgana found herself thinking "I don't care if it starts armageddon, if you don't get that gun out of her face I will use your head for target practice"
- Both of us getting "invisible ink!" at the same time and saying it in unison
- The first mansion investigation, where Morgana wanted to cold-case you after your call with Holland, except now that's relived with an emotion of "what the fuck was wrong with me"
- Bringing you to LRS and realising after that she trusted you with the information completely
- Watching you run the Enigma rescue and adding you to the list of "people I would take a bullet for without even having to think about it"

### How Morgana sees them

## Izzy

## Magpie

- Bullshit sharpshooting bonuses
- 

## Rest of Ace Squad
