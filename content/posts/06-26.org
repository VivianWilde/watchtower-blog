* <2024-06-26 Wed>
** Convo
- Hannaly is doing better than we thought
- So is Breacher!
- Mine incident: Dalton describes it as "interesting", and seems vaguely concerned.
- Holly: "Show that she's unharmed"
- Enigma  "As long as there's a fight hemlock will be there." Or something to that effect

* Clown <2024-06-27 Thu>
- <Stuff happens>
- Clown remembers vague memories about being a child here, watching blorbo and then waking up in a grave
- The memories of Malachai seem to be missing
- Blorbo spawns, blorbo knows we'll follow it
- There's a doctor in the chair in room 666
- Don't worry watchers, it'll be consistent but also inconsistent, isn't that great.
- A second doctor spawns by Malcolm, and sprinkles purple dust on the Clown's grave.
- The eldritch horror: Chaos, uncontrolled, mysterious.
- It's just Bill Cipher
- Malachai made a deal with it, to get the Clown resurrected
- Cipher to clown: "Inverse crocodile"
- The eldritch horror is Paradox/Pair O' Docs, Hemlock coordinator
- Breacher might die soon
- It seems tickled by being called an eldritch horror
* Father-Daughter Reunion
- As long as you're here it means I did the right thing, no matter the cost.
- If Paradox gives you an offer, you have to do it. (Or something like that)
- We're witnessing the formation of HEMLOCK!
* Stuff
- Bedroom in the ghost house in the knight district - temporal shenanigans
- Specifically the computer
- Apparently Tracker is on our squad now!
* Hemlock Spies
- Spy 2: Congratulations on campaign, sure you'll be a huge success, liked to look good.
- Spy 4: Recent assignment to the watchers, probably Brad
- Spy 1: You can go in Tuesday, 2304 to Doctor closest office for Hemlock Evil Therapy
- Lone Master
