OUTDATED, use the discord
# Jane
- Deadly with a sword cane: x3 attacks, 2d6+6 each
- +6 agility and hardiness, insane character, insane-r wis, ?? tech but does that even matter?
- Ability to “smite” people back to their original era, including Watchtower agents.
- Ability to slow others down in order to speed herself up. So a "haste" ability of unknown scale, this is worrying.
- Quite likely has a hopwatch and so weak to temporal (Hat-tip to Phoenix for this one)

# Larry
## Known
### General
- Rarely takes the field, but deadly when he does
- If he's not a field agent, hopefully has low Hardiness and Agility.
- Torturer: Probably likes to draw combat out rather than end it quickly
### Strategies/Combat
- Larry was able to see Nicolas, so some kind of "see invisibility"
### Threads
- It looks like the threads can’t trigger anywhere, Larry needs LOS. There’s also no tracking device, but who’s to say if Larry has some way to track them?
- Needles seemed to shoot Enigma with laser focus every time she told a lie. They seem to somehow be truth-detecting
- Can drain the life out of their targets or reinvigorate them
- Forcing one to age exceptionally fast (if Morton wishes harm): Temporal damage, likely powerful debuff as well
- Speed up their perception of time (if Morton wishes to help): Like Simon's acceleration bubble.
- NOTE: Don't let him boost Jane, that's how we die.
### Counters
- Block him from launching the threads
- Juniper can try to screen him off with force fields
- Find vulnerabilities and take him down quickly
- Cut him off from targets (enemies and allies) and take him out
- How do we keep Jane and Marlow off our backs in the meantime? Phoenix can hold off one of them with backup on a good day.
## Questions
- How do his threads trace targets? Is it telepathic command (in which case we can limit his ability to target things), or something we can fool like heat signatures?
- What do we know about the extent of his immunity to invisibility/holograms? 
- What's his preferred battle strategies/roles? (We can try to deny him this, force him to fight on unfamiliar terms)
- Strong and weak stats (so we know what saves to target)
- Any major abilities or favorite toys beyond the threads?
- Generally, advice on how to take him out or at least stop him from taking us out.
- Note: If she says "I have plans for that, trust me" and refuses to elaborate, or anything like that, I suggest you scream at her "you can't do everything yourself you moron, you tried that with Morgana and look how that turned out."
