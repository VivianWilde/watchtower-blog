title: Darkest Hour
---
* ChronoCo
- Everything is in disarray
* Terrorist Scum!
- Grasshopper is dead
- Enigma, Nic, and Magpie, and the Daltons, are here.
- Simon is also here!
* Conversations
- Cecilia's on our side - not secondhand, but willing to convince Will to stop the apocalypse.
- We need to convince Will on Sunday
- We showed Cecilia the apocalypse
* Breakout
- Watch them on the cameras, try to suss out weaknesses and hidden tricks via Juniper BS
- Riley and Rosemary will scream abuse through the intercoms
- Blast doors: try to isolate Larry
- Jane's masks exist
- So assume Marlow is there ready to neutralise any teleports we apply.
** Zombies
- Drones will teleport and stabilise out foot soldiers
- Warning will sound, and then send them into the zombie room
** Toxic deluge, nonlethal
- Nonlethal debuff gas
- Spiders and snakes and jellyfish drones
- Enigma and Magpie: Hit-and-run tactics, chip away at health before they reach Warlord
- Sidney as our unholy alchemist
** Drone Room
- Miri's remote-controlling the drones
- Manually detonated suicide bombers
- Jane's going to take a Morgana to the face
- Enigma teleports Magpie in to fuck around and take some pot shots.
** Warlord
- Mech
- Rallying mechanics
- Me and Phoenix, against whoever is alive.
- Rosemary: Standing by to deactivate suppressors for a second
- TODO: When Magpie's back, ask for some of her bombs and toys.
** Roles
- Deluge room: Send an Enigma drone to pincushion Larry's threads
- Warlord: Simon heals, MacIntyre buffs, Phoenix tanks, Juniper support and nukes, Damien to tank
* Larry
-Larry's Threads are very strange, and feel almost like they have a mind of their own. When attached, they can drain a target, stealing their life or even progressing them quickly through time.
-The Threads can control limbs they are embedded in: by default those limbs just go numb, but things could be worse…
-Larry is seen talking to his threads often.
-Larry’s Watch is custom, and is the spool around which the threads are wrapped. It seems to warp and shift in shape, as if its properties change.
-Larry has ~20 threads
-Larry’s favorite appetizer is Deviled Eggs

** Ideas
- Codewords to get the threads out
- Deal with the watch
-

* Lone Master
- Flowing hair and opera mask
- Ok fellow gay person
- Artifact: Magic tome. Goddamn nerd
- Has an ability to buff allies
- Buff: 0.1 seconds of futuresight
- Spellcasts at Sidney: Penalties on roll
- Lone Master can block watch abilities
- He has a repositioning ability
- Legendary resist, obviously
* Battle
* Jane
- 

* Larry
- 5 thread actions on a turn
- Threads can heal, confirmed
- Can lifesteal
* Marlow
- Pocketwatch of toys
- Bullshit grenades
- Extra attack
- Has 4 counterspells, spent 1
* Paladin Glasg
* Notes
- Jane and Marlow have panspectrals
- 3 rounds till demolitions make it through
- Possibly 1 if they spend a nightmare

* Weakness
- Mental vulnerability, energy resist for elites
- Larry: currently vulnerable to energy
- Lone Master: Resists mental, vulnerable to temporal
- We can target a thread with mental damage, but doesn't look like anything else
