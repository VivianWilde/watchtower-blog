title: "Magpie's Epilogue: Addendum"
---

Luna's not even surprised when she walks into her office and sees Magpie rooting through her drawers, desperately looking for trinkets to pawn. They've worked out a tacit arrangement where Magpie never takes anything too important, and she'll usually steal it back if Luna promises enough credits (Magpie gives Luna the 'friends and family' 0.1% discount. It's her own little way of showing she cares)
"No Magpie, I don't have any credits"
Magpie turns to Luna and hesitates for a minute. Luna sighs "if your next sentence is about organs I swear..."
"I need permission for a jump"
"Is this about the crown jewels again? Because if so, I already told you no. Several times"
Magpie shakes her head. "No. This one's... personal". She opens her mouth as if she's about to say something, but instead she silently hands Luna a slip of paper with a list of coordinates.
Luna plugs them into the Watcher archives, just to be safe. The computer whirrs for a minute and then bright green text flashes `1 reference found in Personnel Files`. There's a small preview of the result - a grainy photo of a watcher sitting with an ice-cream cone, waving to the camera.
Luna's silent for a while, lost in memories. She snaps back to the sound of a pen scratching on paper, the Magpie trying to forge her signature. Luna rolls her eyes and snatches the pen away, finishing the signature.
As Luna hands back the form, she looks down like she's trying to find the words to say something. "Could you tell her.... Never mind. "
Something passes unsaid between them, and the Magpie nods in understanding. And then she's off, a blue streak flying through the window.
The pen has disappeared off the table (no surprises there), but the Magpie's been kind enough to leave the coordinates there untouched. Luna takes out a photo album from her top drawer, and leafs through a few dozen cat pictures until she finds a free square. She adds the coordinates to the top of her ever-growing to-do list, and then files the paper away.

At midnight, while everyone sane is asleep and Enigma is filling out field reports in her office, the Magpie flashes her shiny new permission slip to Barney, and punches in the coordinates.
That night, as she trails Morgana through the streets of the Watchtower, she whispers "your sister says she misses you."
