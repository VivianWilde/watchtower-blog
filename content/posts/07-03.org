* Raise Your Glass High For Tomorrow We Die
- False pretenses
- We're both here
- Jane Doe drugged Leonardo DaVinci
- Jane Doe has a cane. She tends to have one a lot, it's one of her tells
- Person in a trench coat took Enigma's watch. Presumably to add Watcher spyware
- Video:
** Questioning
- To Enigma: "Where were you in the mines?"
- Enigma: "Someone from somewhere who could change and destroy everything"
- Enigma was supposed to be dead, I don't like this new Enigma as much as the old
- We needed an Enigma to die in the mines to start the whole thing off, but you didn't die.
** Information
- Breacher has secondhand contacts
- Clown is Hemlock
- We sent the video of the bomb-retrieval so they know grasshoper, Clown, and Rosemary. Shit.
 
* Council Meeting
- Lone Master is here in person
- Lone Master now knows about Clinton
- Anderson bots can see invisibility, and also stealth
- Paradox is about but weakened, Galloway has been revealed
* Temporal Faults
** Brief
- Haunted House
- Dinosaur Park in ChronoLand
- CTE
- Addresses of secondhand operatives in the Watchtower: Grasshopper. Obtained from us. Fuck

** Turning Traitor
- TODO: Ask bloodhounds about hiding behind Alec Wilde's skirts.
- I'll definitely have the Watchers out for me.
- I doubt Wilde will protect a new agent from the Watchers that much
- Enigma's home destroyed by secondhand operations.
- Oh shit ChronoCo industrial espionage
- Nope not going to work Enigma's going to stay Watcher

  I'm guessing there's no chance in hell of Enigma leaving the Watchers, even after today? Morgana would honestly consider running to minutemen or chronoco or even knight intelligence after today, but she knows that if Enigma stays Larry's going to kill you to punish me and that's not happening

** Dinosaur Park
- Solving paradoxes: We need to route around it or use weird ChronoCo tech
- Temporal lock is wonky.
- Bloody handprint: Only breacher took temporal damage, and then it vanished.
- Robot: Doing something that is null.
- So they had an objective, that was then "undone" from the timestream somehow
- Time sense: A body against the wall.
- Body of a bald minuteman.
- Basketball-sized fault - matte, eyes slide off of it.
*** Robot footage
- Robot sent reports: Videos show it "shooting at nothing" when we do a tech check to get its brain.
- Handcuffs got put on someone, they disappeared and got jumped by robots
- Saw them die a second time, gunned down in a minuteman alley, maybe not by bots.
- Robot explodes with purple energy
** Knight House
- Watch for the hanged lady
- Photographs hurt
- House is abandoned
- Abandoned but has photographs
- House looks lived in, but allegedly abandoned
- TV: Moon Detective. Like in Tasha's estate.
- Crying in the kitchen
- Kitchen: A lady sitting at a table curled up
- Inconsistencies: Ice cream on the table from a few days ago.
- Pictures: Someone was airbrushed out of them.
- Picture of Tasha
- Enigma got downed. Again
- Christmas tree disappears, father is just shadowy.
- Saw someone definitely not existing, who's been erased from the timeline.
- Woman hanging from the ceiling fan. Blonde haired knight uniform
*** Letter
- Dad, I'm sorry. ... The council thinks I'm a mess. There's nothing left for me here.
- Lylan of the minuteman
**  TODO
- Investigate Mrs. Claus.
** After that
- Handcuffs are for AC units
- AC units: Known factory
- Access: Submit form for tour, else secret. Work there, or...
- Security systems:
- We see Anderson, she mentions a news item
- We couldn't get specs but we got a locatin
- Cuffs: Shocks someone through all of time, so they die at every moment and are erased from all time
- Not quite erasing, more altering, and only works on our main canonical timeline
*** Fixing
- Alter invention of the cuffs so that it did something like send someone to a pocket dimension would get around this.
- Use an alternate timeline to get alt-timeline versions of AC and Clinton and integrate them back in
- Reverse engineer an anti-cuff. A temporal restorer.
* Santa's Gulag
- Feeling of cold and being whisked away
- Wake up in a soft bed
- Scent of freshly baked cookies
- Mrs Claus: Shrouded in snow, holding a plate of cookies
- Morgana's going to assume she's dead.
- I have some cookies in my pocket
