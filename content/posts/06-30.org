* Cat Convo
- Not a receptacle
- Saw Selene slightly before she last saw Tasha
- Selene ran downstairs, below the house.
- 8-9 sleeps ago. So when the 21 days dates from
- So around the deathday
- Tasha wrote "21 days" close to the time of her death
- 21 days could be a calendar.
- Cat: Does not remember seeing Malcolm
- Went down to the basement, got placed on a disk and got a little bit woozy, and then no memories after that
- Then being taken off the disc, and Tasha comes down, pops out a tube and gets worried and writing stuff and putting up the
- So some of the post-its came after Selene and cat visited the resort.
- Conjecture: Was someone receptacled into the cat.
- So Tasha was receptacled into the cat, or possibly Madame E.
- Any bouts of wooziness since then: "Not that I can remember"
* Selene Letter
- I hope you can forgive me
- May have to leave at short notice
- Only way to keep you safe
- She left this at LRS intentionally
- So she's been leaving a trail for Miri, and she figured that one of Miri's friends would be at LRS at this time
* Leads
- Pompeii
- Holland's time tech
- Temporal rifts: Haunted house in the knights district, temporal rifts. One in CTE.
- Rachel Anderson: We were attacked by Anderson bots, and also we have cold-case video of Anderson going "the cuffs worked"
* Pompeii
- Miri has coordinates
- Volcanic activity, not erupting yet
- The apocalypse is coming and no one is doing anything
- Seeking Aunt Mildred of the Secondhand
- Magpie: Past sight, see the last person who was here and what they're doing
- We're following Pete, he jumped to these coordinates.
- Follow Pete, takes a right down an alleyway
- Pete's wearing a large coat/cloak
- They knocked on a door, we have a street address.
- Knock pattern
- Entrypoints: Gutter, window, door
- Some rats
- Chimp talking to Mildred
- Interior: Strange, out of place, crate with english writing
** Conversation
- "Yes yes"
- Also, the figure has the ability to speak Chimpanzee.
- So it's a secondhander
- "What do you mean? Being followed?"
- "Watchers?"
- "We only have 30 minutes, been a good run, given lack of capsule."
- "Get parts back to base, should be good to go"
- Pocketwatch what we can, and carry the rest.
- "Detective? Looking into you? Are they one of Tasha's?"
- I think she was off to the temple
- "Bury the rest"
- 10 minutes: Circling looking for a temple
- Two buildings with fountains, one is obviously a temple.
*** Temple
- Writing on the wall: "Venice", "Paris"
- Someone showing up in purple at an altar of Minerva
- There are a few time travellers and someone with a pocketwatch
- Person is Frida Aldeman!
** Magpie Update
- They shared a video. Probably not doctored
- With one minute left - Frida pulled out a masquerade mask, looked directly at the magpie,
- "You're the one they sent? I thought they'd send the kid but I'm okay with that"
- So Frida was waitng for us, and probably watching Mildred
- The kid should know the locker combo by now
- Interpretation: Vault door code.
- "Storm is coming", etc.
- To find Selene, look elsewhere, a different time.
- Selene's trying to save us all, in the belly of the beast
- TODO where is this
- Check out Holland, find Holland's engineers and you'll find Selene
- So we have vault combo
- Egypt dates were relevant for the combo
- We got the combo!

* Vault
- A bunch of mechanical crap
- Drawing table: Part of a blueprint
- Temporal stabiliser
- Tasha was stealing random parts from meetings, especially ChronoCo.
- Parts: Miri knows this tech! From Selene, and her parents.
- Watcher tech! Threading timelines together, and writing over anomalies so they don't cascade. But reverse-engineered.
- Finding how it works to do the opposite
- 1/3 of a blueprint for a temporal stabiliser/paradox stopper
- Soup has pictures of the plans.
* Holland's Engineer
- Speculation: Selene blipped into a new timeline or an existing alternate timeline
- Mining contacts: Sometimes people are pricks when they get promoted
- One guy, fired recently. Something with an "H". "Harrison" or something. "Hairy Harry".
- So he probably knows stuff
- He might be a "dissident", possibly accidental
- He probably knows things but isn't directly involved
- 2 days ago, fired.
- That's in cold-case range!

** Harry Harrison
- Designing the mine elevator
- Fired because it got picked
- Lot of the others are working from home
- In a nice place, probably living it up, not reachable by mail
- Conjecture: Other engineers are in an alternate timeline.
- Harry: "Sort of in an alternate timeline"
- We need coordinates to find them, we could go via Holly but that's unlikely.
- We could hack or spy?
- They didn't even take my stuff or delete my laptop

*** Apartment Laptop Theft
- Talked to a dog, it went awry
- We got treats to calm it down
- Dog distracted the lobby person
- Designs: Modified time capsules
- Some riffing occured to get the security questions
- We got everything downloaded to the USB.
- We're out!

** Laptop Insights
- "You're being relocated to a luxurious spot in timeline XYZ, you will be in charge of the society here". So we have coordinates, and Selene is hiding somewhere in the engineers hideline.
- We have all the data
- Including coords on both mining and engineer-palace timelines.
* Highlights
- Cat is clean now, but Tasha receptacled into it for LRS
- They had a bunch of parts which they brought back to secondhand HQ presumably
- Met Frida Aleman
- Frida has a mask that lets her see magpie, either timesense or /see invisibility/
- She's working with Selene and knows Miri
- "Selene is trying to save us all"
- "Find Holland's engineers and you'll find Selene"
- We opened the vault door. Code used some stuff we've found already, plus also the precise date of the Egypt mission
- 1/3 of a blueprint for a temporal stabiliser/paradox stopper, secondhand project
- We stole coordinates for a timeline where Holland's engineers are staying, that's our next stop to find Selene, hopefully our last.
** Speculation
- "Selene trying to save us all" is intriguing
- Frida's here in person. This is significant. Why is she here, what does she know?
- Is she the one who put the LRS entry in the Watcher archives?
- From the chat logs forever ago: (To Mildred) "Wait for me. Found something. Talking to detective shortly". From Uncle Benny (Tuhorn), about 6:10 on Tasha's deathday (so ~30 minutes before murder)
- So Tuhorn was in conversation with a detective
