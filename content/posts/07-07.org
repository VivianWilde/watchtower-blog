title: Let Me Know If You See Any Good Cows
---
* Paradox
- Banished to the Time Mines in Mr TIME's mind
- Rosemary is traumatised now
* Engineer Timeline
- Desert vibes
- Like in the video
- A castle on a hill
- Medieval-style houses
- Giant mound of some strange dirt and skeletons
- "The mayor" opening up that place after so long
- "Should be nice for us to visit"
- Two manequins with outfits
- There's some purple, and purple was rare in normal medieval times.
- Mayor's shindig in the castle: Wear something fancy
- Unscrupulous devil-worshippers
- The devil was here. The devil takes many forms. But with the power of teamwork ...
- The town of Amity
** Cows
- Three eyed cow
- There's a cow with an extra leg sticking out of the back
- "Cow mafia"
- All the animals are mutated
- Crops: Decayed
- Trees, grass are fine, a little gnarled but okay.
- No effect from age. So it's not a recent thing
** Devil
- Devil was buried six months ago
- ChronoCo arrived 2 months ago
- Bodies are mutated, some stillborn, some decaying
- They were hit with a "yeti sonic attack", i.e radiation poisoning
- Most likely general nuclear radiation
- So it's probably a reactor or radioactive waste
- Some of the townspeople are a little mutated, but mostly normal.
- Mutants are all on the mound
- Not many young people in this town
- Younger bodies on the mound
# - "Morgana... nevermind we'll do this later". Yikes
- Castle is about a century old
- So where did the reactor/waste come from
** Castle
- Had a wand to detect time-tech
- The demons promise "infinity", odd word for a medieval peasant
- "The blight is theirs, their doing"
- How can we tell what a demon looks like? The wand
- But the demons made the wand
- The wand was taken by those brave enough to fight
- "New monarchs were powerless". "No divine right"
- Demon powers: Anything, with their magic, but without implements they can do nothing
- The doors are underneath the digwell
- Two/one months ago: Holland's engineers. A demon claimed
- Purple haired one was here: She tricked us into opening the well and disappeared through it.
- Disappeared about a month ago.
