- In the CTE
- We saw an illusory image of myself, tracking time fluid with the magpie back in Greece.
- What does this mean? Is it related to the AC paradox?
- Is something coming back around? Was it a warning to be aware of time fluid?
- "Nicolas Aurora"

** Santa Claus
- Nicolas Aurora
- May or may not be in Watcher personnel files
- Gave me an unlit cartoon bomb
- Apparently current Saint Nick is his successor

** Marlow
- Is he the Lone Master's?
- Marlow has three anti-receptacle crowns. So it can lock someone in their head, or lock someone out of being a receptacle target.
- Acquired from ChronoCo.
- ChronoCo could use it to probe the receptacle's thoughts.
- Marlow is a tactical combatant and a trapper.
# - Make sure to choose your battleground carefully if you have to fight him.
** Compound
*** Approach 1
- Fight across the bridge of elden
*** Approach 2: Stealth
- Crags
- Deal with time fluid and genetically-engineered sea monsters
*** Approach 3: Beam into the sky and drop down
- Unknown anti-air defenses, but purple lightning that can strike targets down
** Invasion
- Find a door.
- Jeremy's are intelligent: If a rock is thrown then it investigates the source.
- Marlow and Simon are running through the tunnels.
- There's a dragon.
- Damien's at a relay holding off the dragon
- Saint Nick took out a goon at a turret via pushing him to his death
- Hangar: Vehicles, beasts, Jeremies, weird fish-things (Is this Innsmouth)
- Primed to make an exit.
- Paradox has surprises about, and knows the Clown is here.
- We got Robo-Stalin!
** Creel
- I'll be honest I checked out around the time therapy happened, hopefully Enigma has better notes.
- Damien's a refugee, Creel is 27
- Paladin Creel is a faker in a mask. A figurehead.
- Creel dies all the time, they recover the mask
- Damien goes off to start a commune.
