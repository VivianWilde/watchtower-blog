<p>I amped cold-case so that it conveys subjective impressions as well as just events. This is most certainly not a copout so that I can avoid having to follow the &ldquo;show, don&rsquo;t tell&rdquo; maxim. Canonically, the thing that decided Morgana&rsquo;s break from the watchers was her imagining Miri dying as an 18 year old and swearing that she&rsquo;d die rather than stand by and let that happen (and die she did)</p>
<h2 id="enigma">Enigma</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eye-rolling at the knights together</li>
<li>Bouncy Castle night</li>
<li>Ice-cream after we got the bomb out</li>
<li>Dragging you to an ice-cream celebration with ace squad</li>
<li>A timelapse of getting punched by Enigma, and Morgana getting better and better at interpreting them as affection</li>
<li>The shared moment of &ldquo;Simon what the fuck&rdquo; with you in Holland&rsquo;s timeline, and then just Morgana missing you terribly.</li>
<li>Hanging out in Izzy&rsquo;s apartment when she mentioned the &ldquo;one of us might have to die&rdquo; part of the plan, and Morgana privately resolving &ldquo;whatever happens it won&rsquo;t be Enigma&rdquo;</li>
<li>Izzy&rsquo;s house again - seeing you tolerating the cats despite yourself</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-morgana-sees-them">How Morgana sees them</h3>
<ul>
<li>Abstractly, she&rsquo;s a bit of a mess but Morgana loves her so dearly</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="breacher">Breacher</h2>
<ul>
<li>Everytime Breacher posited &ldquo;maybe ___ is future you or me&rdquo; and Morgana religiously filed that away</li>
<li>Putting the pieces together</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-morgana-sees-them-1">How Morgana sees them</h3>
<ul>
<li>She looked up to Breacher so much</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rosemary">Rosemary</h2>
<p>Watching you lock down 1/3 of a pirate fleet with contract negotiations</p>
<p>Recommending you to Izzy for the &ldquo;kill Paradox&rdquo; squad, and being completely certain you could do it<br>
A scene of</p>
<ul>
<li>Hearing from Izzy about how you nuked Paradox</li>
<li>When Holly Holland pointed a gun at you and Morgana found herself thinking &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if it starts armageddon, if you don&rsquo;t get that gun out of her face I will use your head for target practice&rdquo;</li>
<li>Both of us getting &ldquo;invisible ink!&rdquo; at the same time and saying it in unison</li>
<li>The first mansion investigation, where Morgana wanted to cold-case you after your call with Holland, except now that&rsquo;s relived with an emotion of &ldquo;what the fuck was wrong with me&rdquo;</li>
<li>Bringing you to LRS and realising after that she trusted you with the information completely</li>
<li>Watching you run the Enigma rescue and adding you to the list of &ldquo;people I would take a bullet for without even having to think about it&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
