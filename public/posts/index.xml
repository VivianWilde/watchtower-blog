      <description>Session Watchers at the throat of the minutemen Thorwald is also anti-minutemen, on the same side as the whisperer Watcher and ChronoCo: There&amp;#39;s a lot, but we don&amp;#39;t know the details ChronoCo vs knights: Dr. Lightborn is anti-knight, no fighting yet. So we can convince knights that Holly was unsanctioned Convince chronoCo that the bullshit was Larry Pitch Meeting TIME has a paradox in his head, but seems under control Cecilia hugged Rosemary!</description>

      <description>As Jane taps her stick against the ground, Morgana whispers a curse under her breath, and prepares to reach new heights of stupidity - willingly drawing the attention of the walking nightmare named Jane Doe. She settles on her favorite kind of distraction - a bullet fired straight for Jane&amp;#39;s trademark swordstick.&#xA;It misses, of course. But it does its job, as Jane looks away from the stabiliser and whips around to chase them down.</description>

      <description>Jane Deadly with a sword cane: x3 attacks, 2d6+6 each +6 agility and hardiness, insane character, insane-r wis, ?? tech but does that even matter? Ability to “smite” people back to their original era, including Watchtower agents. Ability to slow others down in order to speed herself up. So a &amp;ldquo;haste&amp;rdquo; ability of unknown scale, this is worrying. Quite likely has a hopwatch and so weak to temporal (Hat-tip to Phoenix for this one) Larry Known General Rarely takes the field, but deadly when he does If he&amp;rsquo;s not a field agent, hopefully has low Hardiness and Agility.</description>
