<li>The Egypt group were the only people who traveled through the CTE between the time windows of when the murder happened</li>

<li>Barney (CTE doorman) says he never saw Seline use the CTE despite claims that she did so to escape</li>
<li>Councilor Galloway recalls that you can’t hop through Watchtowers using watches (blocked by design), at least that he knows of</li>
<li>Councilor Jane Doe may have had access to the Watchtower information that was stolen</li>

Accounts from Alec Wilde
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Wilde states that though he didn&#39;t particularly like her, Tasha was like family and he was dedicated to protecting her</li>
<li>The Knights didn’t seem to like Tasha</li>
<li>Tasha spoke highly of Tilda Clinton</li>
<li>Wilde believes a Councilor was part of the theft at the Watchtower, as some of the information that was stolen was so confidential it wasn’t even in the public Archives</li>
<li>The other general documents that were stolen were encrypted and shipped away</li>
<li>Wilde suspects the theft was a distraction for something much greater</li>
