<li>Lightning Gun : Standard High Tech</li>
<li>Eight step plan of world domination</li>
<li>First step: Trickery, done</li>
<li>Second step has happened now. or will happen now. You&#39;ll never know.</li>
<li>When the skies turn red and the dinosaurs rain from above.</li>
<li>Reagan: Your opinions wont be what you want, but I assure you we&#39;re still evil.</li>
<li>We&#39;re behind every inconvenience</li>
<li>Third: Those that have risen shall fall, those that fell have already risen and shall rise to the highest spire</li>
<li>Fourth: Be careful what you wish for, those that come. New leaders not who you think they are.</li>
<li>Fifth: Step away from the TIME man.</li>
<li>Percentages, really</li>
<li>Dinosaurs: Maybe a little more literal than metaphorical. You&#39;ll see. You have to stop it as it happens, and then before it happens. Some kind of paradox. But he implies it won&#39;t stop the overall plan.</li>

Cold Case
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Cold Case stops 3.5 days ago. I took temporal damage, which isâ€¦ bad</li>
<li>In a morgue somewhere, person dressed in clown makeup is above him, and he runs, until pulled into Watcher custody.</li>
<li>So this is the scarman who was killed in Florence.</li>
<li>Timeline is weird.</li>
<li>3.5 days ago in his personal timeline, Salamas man woke up with a clown staring over his head, and got taken into watcher custody - the thing that should have happened to Florence man 6 hours ago.</li>
<li>Likely not receptacle shenanigans, instead time fuckery.</li>
<li>Only possibility (under known rules): At 3.5 days ago, Salamas man was receptacle-possessing Florence man</li>
<li>Internal consistency has been broken</li>
<li>Basically: Cold Case should always respect watchtower time. But, this time, personal time overruled - 3.5 days ago cold-case time was 6 hours ago watchtower time.</li>
<li>Basically: T-3.5d Salamas receptacled into T-6h Florence. And so was receptacled for the resurrection.</li>

After
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Salamas man ran out from time labs, Florence came from council. That checks out, Florence guy stole something from the council.</li>
<li>Salamas man knew revivification was in his future, and he was rooting around the lab studying revivification.</li>

Time Labs
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Lockdown: Door, windows barricaded</li>
<li>Accident in the labs: Zephyr is trapped, infestation of zombies</li>
<li>Resulted from failed experiments with revivification - the bodies were fine, but failed to bring the minds/brains back (I&#39;m hazy on the distincting)</li>
<li>We fought through zombies, saved some, Damien killed a bunch of innocents, yada yada yada</li>

Footage
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Scarred man leaving the lab, corroborates out-of-lab footage.</li>
<li>&#34;They couldn&#39;t have jumped in here unless the revivification pad setup was used as a jump entrance point&#34;.</li>
<li>Even this is only possible with something strange.</li>
<li>Figure was plausibly re-animated.</li>

Zephyr
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Has developed a sort of mind storage receptacle.</li>
<li>Going into the past, taking the mind from just before death, storing it on a time SSD, and putting it into the new body.</li>
<li>Possibility: Plans, etc. about the body swap device could have been stolen.</li>
<li>Messes with the person&#39;s internal time engine. Since the watch-person connection is severed by death, but then reignited by revivification.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Zephyr recognised the scarred man. Jake Robertson, assistant at other ChronoCo lab, connections to other factions, suspected Secondhand agent. Leitborn or Tuhorn recommended him to Zephyr&#39;s research group. Possibility: One copy of them stole Council secrets, other stole plans from the lab.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: The clown&#39;s revivification of scarman and shenanigans are what caused this to happen.</li>

Temporal Physics Details
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Scarman died at some point in time.</li>
<li>The death basically messed up their watch&#39;s timeline, i.e their internal timeline as tracked by their watch.</li>
</ul>
<div id="outline-container-headline-11" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="headline-11">
First Theory
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-5">
<ul>
<li>They were brought back ~3 days later, so by watchtower <em>age</em> they&#39;re 3 days younger than by watchtower <em>time</em>.</li>
<li>Since their watch was only tracking them for $T-3$ days, and watchtower time was running for $T$ days.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Basically, their watch says their $T-3$ days old, watchtower says their T days old. If dies in 2023, and revive in 2024, their Watch says they haven&#39;t aged, out of sync with watch timeline</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-5">
<h5 id="headline-12">
Second Theory
</h5>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-5">
<ul>
<li>Death is just turning back the clock on internal time, and thus on their watch time.</li>
<li>Eg: You die at 32. I pull your 31 year old mind back into your resurrected body. Your personal watch says you are 31. Body is in 2024, mind could plausibly be from 2023.</li>
<li>The missing piece that Zephyr&#39;s stuck on is working on pulling the mind from the past. He says he&#39;d be interested in hints towards that.</li>
<li>3 days: Revivification makes them confused, because of the 3 day time drift. It&#39;s like 4 dimensional jet lag I think.</li>
<li><strong>Takeaway</strong>: Revival could have messed up the clock, because there&#39;s a conflict between it being $32$ years since their birth (watchtower time) and their mind only being $31$ years old (personal watch time, and also actual age)</li>
