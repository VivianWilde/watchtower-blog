Tasha
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Alec mentioned Tasha had been acting strange recently</li>
<li>Alec: &#34;Tasha knew something before she died.&#34;</li>
<li>Tasha had been frantic recently, terrified, not her usual optimistic self. Talking to shady figures (shady by Alec standards). For the past few weeks.</li>
<li>Been running back to her estate mid-day, even missing meetings for it.</li>
<li>Tasha ostensibly never jumped, recently started asking Alec about time tech and trying to acquire a watch (about a month ago)</li>
<li>Potential Lead: Alec put Tasha in touch with some contact about acquiring a watch.</li>
<li>She&#39;s been in the knights district frequently.</li>
<li>Potential Lead: Clinton and Tasha had a lot to discuss, and Tasha was raising eyebrows at Clinton in the council meeting on her deathday.</li>
<li>(Probably nothing) Tasha was really into &#34;Moon Detective&#34;, a bad scifi detective TV show from the 50s.</li>

Estate
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Holly wanted to buy the estate, pissed that Miri has it</li>
<li>Library: Political structure of the watchtower, and books from across time.</li>
<li>Library: Dr Zephyrs books &#34;The Trouble with T.I.M.E&#34; about timeline ruptures and stabilisation, and &#34;Living your next life: Quasi-temporal revivification&#34;. (NOTE: Jane Doe heard a revivification talk in the council, did not like it, for unspecified reasons)</li>
<li>Crest in the wall behind the library.</li>
<li>Golden key on the coffee table, don&#39;t know what it unlocks.</li>
<li>Two bedrooms, both in use recently. So Tasha was living with someone.</li>

Journal
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t have enough time. I need to find it before they do.</li>
<li>Selene should know, she&#39;s told me so much.</li>
<li>As long as I can get to the other time I can figure out.
&#34;There&#39;s no receptacle though, it can&#39;t be used&#34;.</li>
<li>I feel like I&#39;m going crazy</li>
<li>The fact that nobody knows makes them the crazy one.</li>
<li>&#34;Worried about Madame E and Selene. Don&#39;t know if I can trust them. But I need to know&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;I think it&#39;s Holly. Something about that mining operation. She&#39;s been hiding something from the whole council. Another timeline?&#34;</li>
<li>She&#39;s not just mining for time fluid.</li>

<ul>
<li>Found in Tasha&#39;s office</li>
<li>Rosemary, Holly, Frog, some businessman, and some mysterious armored figure in the chronoCo column.</li>
<li>Frog: &#34;Lost in transit&#34;, Armed figure: &#34;Tester&#34;</li>
<li>Thorwald elsewhere crossed out, &#34;knows about it&#34; (that is also crossed out), &#34;useful idiot&#34;</li>
<li>?? over a blue tab (watchers?), pictures of Lone Master, Jane Doe, and Whisperer and the British cane dude (Marlow)</li>
<li>Trashcan has pictures of Madame E and Selene.</li>

<li>Book key at the top. &#34;Time War&#34;</li>
<li>Actual message: From Tasha: &#34;Night knowledge collected. Worried about watch agent. Buy the wax seal stamp.&#34;</li>

Computer
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Holly ghosted Tasha&#39;s attempts to fish for information</li>
<li>Small message group (&#34;book club&#34;), exchanged book names, possibly a way to share message keys.</li>
<li>Mentions of &#34;the end, the storm&#34;, ostensibly film. Someone &#34;worried about the franchise&#34;</li>
<li>Tasha asked Holly for support on making minutemen official faction</li>
<li>Someone (her contact in Pompeii) visited 2 months ago.</li>
<li>3 watchtower agents implicated in this. We have their contacts, need to trace them. Scarred man was probably one of them.</li>

Film (Collection of disconnected scenes)
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>People bowing to a giant gold chronoCo logo and Holly Holland walking out</li>
<li>Mining operations on Earth, probably an alternate-timeline or historical earth. This earth looks less polluted/trashed than ours. Different infrastructure - the mining looks like an entire mining &#34;district&#34;. Looks like it was built anew, rather than on top of an existing city. Looks like it was built to be a mining operation and has been solely a mining operation for a while.</li>
<li>Desert: Bombed/fallout vibes. Building and a pool are the only nice features, and a towel saying &#34;LRS&#34; (NOTE: Tasha had an LRS handkerchief)</li>
<li>Blue haired middle-aged man: Roughly matches the description of Malachai von Spatz, from the lore. Perhaps a relative or younger version, but perhaps not. Might be an alternate-timeline version of him, but that&#39;s unlikely.</li>
<li>Final shot: Icy background, someone looking for something. Right: Orange haired 18 year old waving at camera, points to a tetrahedron.</li>
