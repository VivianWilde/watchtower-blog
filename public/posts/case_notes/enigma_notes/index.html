<h1 id="session-1-florence">Session 1: Florence</h1>
<ul>
<li>I was assigned ; we are a squadron who was recently put together regarding incidents regarding the Council (Damien, Simon, Ace and Tracker are paladin Knights, Jett and Breacher are minutemen, Hurlabur is a Chrono-Co councilor and I’m a Watcher)</li>
<li>We start in the barracks of a unit run by the Knights ; Damien is checking his equipment, and he seems to know everyone; he is a model Knight, higher up in the chain of command through his connections to the higher ups; he’s in every promo piece as the face of the Knights (a real model American goody two shoes)</li>
<li>High Paladin Creal is in attendance, which has everyone on edge</li>
<li>Simon Bastil was a combatant turned medic after a war injury; he’s groggy and hears of whispers and rumors about the incident with the Council</li>
<li>AC-001X (Ace for short) is a robot; he’s in the breakroom plugged into a microwave (his Councilor is Tilda)</li>
<li>R.R. Hurlabur (dapper frog of human size) is a Chrono-Co representative Councilman; he steps into the War Room where I reside, and the meeting commences</li>
<li>The one heading the meeting (Tilda Clinton) is slightly displeased with my presence, as it means the Watchers are here to keep them in check</li>
<li>Something has been stolen, and the goal is to retrieve it, maintain secrecy, and keep the timeline in check; a man named Oraks is believed to be a terrorist who stole information in order to lead a second-hand revolution; there were bombings in the Watchtower, and Oraks was tracked as having escaped capture by jumping to the Italian renaissance to meet a contact (we don’t know the contact, or at least Chrono-Co won’t tell); he was last spotted in the medici pallets in florence before the trail went cold; we need to stop the meeting</li>
<li>Receptacles are whats being used by these terrorists</li>
<li>We are to find a list of names that cannot be revealed (as well as Oraks and his contact); the Knights are to send a small team to follow Oraks (us) while the Knights launch assaults on other suspects</li>
<li>Oraks doesn’t have time-manipulation abilities and he doesn’t have the means to get out of his predicament, but his contact might have something</li>
<li>We must look for suspicious Receptacles</li>
<li>Orak stole from the Council and was supposedly under the jurisdiction of Chrono-Co (this is a rumor)</li>
<li>Damien is to lead the infiltration team (us)</li>
<li>Creal says the longer we wait the longer changes will set in (also the Watchers are on their ass, and by that I mean me lmao)</li>
<li>Hurlabur shakes Damien’s hand and mistakes him for a small girl (he is very tall and doesn’t understand human gender)</li>
<li>Central Time Engine is in the Watchtower and is where we jump throughout time</li>
<li>Ace tries to understand jokes because he is a robot and keeps attempting to do human humor (he jokes with Creal and gets chokeslammed by the guy)</li>
<li>Hurlabur is a capitalist; Jasper is his butler who is the nephew of someone he knows (Jasper is played by an actual person)</li>
<li>Damien makes us do group introductions; Hurlabur is trying to rebuild some standing with fellow Councilors and wants to see the sights; Ace is a robot who was instructed to be here; Damien is our leader and a Knight; I pointedly don’t introduce myself despite Damien asking</li>
<li>Hurlabur says all frogs are capable of speaking but don’t have the ambition to learn</li>
<li>I grill Damien on the plans; we will info gather and create a plan (because we do not have one), and the contingency plan is to kidnap the whole building and mindwipe them which is a big no no for me; Ace points this out quite helpfully</li>
<li>Damien is trying to have a good attitude and I am ever stony in making it known that I do not care if this mission fails, I simply wish for the timeline to be maintained and will ensure it by any means, even if the mission fails</li>
<li>Ace suggests using temporal handcuffs to interrogate the suspects on site, though the Knights want them brought back as prisoners</li>
<li>Everyone gets into a debate about the morality of killing communists</li>
<li>Damien isn’t the most planned or prepared, and is more focused on team building (he doesn’t really have a solid plan and wants to murder communists despite the team supposed to bring them back)</li>
<li>Despite Hurlabur, Ace and Damien’s various rants about communism, we eventually head to the Engine</li>
<li>We arrive at the Engine and a Watcher schedules us to go to Madichi (Barney, he’s a costumer who supplies people with gear and whatnot before timeline traveling)</li>
<li>The Medici’s are the powerful ruling family of Florence, and we’re attending their ball; we don’t know why this is where we were dropped</li>
<li>Damien asks me to pose as his date so he doesn’t get “swarmed by women”; I say its doubtful but given Barney’s suggestion that such an issue could hurt the timeline I comply (Hurlabur asks how intercourse between two women would work. He still thinks Damien is a woman)</li>
<li>Damien keeps calling me Lady Enigma, and I say he is not to shank anyone if it disrupts the timeline (“anything for you Lady Engima”)</li>
<li>i take a simple guest outfit, and we hop through… into Florence, Italy</li>
<li>There is a courtyard, where Breacher bodyswaps into a politician named Linguini (so creative)(also I can tell his aura is off cause I’m op)</li>
<li>Jett is dressed as a Swiss mercenary</li>
<li>Jett suspects three people: Alfredo (male; lesser known sculpture), Fetuchini (female; thief trying to steal something from the ball tonight; has a crew), and Pieri (the kid of Medici, integral to the timeline but also a kid; he can go about the party as he pleases)</li>
<li>I impersonate Clea de Madagia, and Jett is able to get us in by telling us the list names</li>
<li>RR attempts to chat up one of the sculptors impersonating a friend; the sculptor seems nervous and is scrambling to try and get RR to be a patron… that or he’s a spy, cause he doesn’t seem to know anything about his own art per RR’s questioning</li>
<li>I sense splotches of purple (blood) (11 on a d12!!) and follow the trail; Damien annoyingly follows me like a puppy and though I snipe at him I don’t insist he leaves; the stains start to disappear and it takes me to these rooms (Damien sense it after me and I’m like “yeah I know I was following it”)</li>
<li>Ace fails to convince a waiter he’s also one and has to shift faces with another person to avoid getting chased</li>
<li>”Is he touching everybody or just people who look like him?” - Manav</li>
<li>Sam keeps naming the NPCs after pasta</li>
<li>As Ace is fucking around changing faces trying to avoid capture, the whole place shudders purple for me (i don’t know its him that caused the shudder)</li>
<li>The trail I’m following dies into a hallway leading to a series of rooms; we split up to investigate each room per Damien’s suggestion</li>
<li>Damien’s room has an opened briefcase with a 1704 passcode; its empty and he hands it to me; its from the 19th century and has traces of purple fluid, watch fuel perhaps; there is a broken watch accompanied with the case</li>
<li>Breacher recognizes a waiter that walks by and follows her (pretty sure its Ace disguised)</li>
<li>I pick up the watch to analyze and my fingers get a bit burnt with temporal energy (+2 temporal damage); I can’t discern anything other than it was broken in transit so the holder might be in trouble</li>
<li>Lorenzo, the big Medici, is talking with Leonardo da Vinci; Jett walks into their convo (big time no no) and starts engaging in intellectual conversation; Medici starts questioning him</li>
<li>da Vinci tells Jett about the possibilities of tanks and moon landings and Jett has to play dumb</li>
<li>RR is talking to someone who Breacher’s drones had been tracking; she seems nervous… she’s pacing and possibly waiting</li>
<li>Ace meets up with me, Damien and Bastil; I can see prints that lead to the courtyard, meaning we passed them; I go to the courtyard alone after giving Damien the case and don’t see purple</li>
<li>Damien starts talking to a woman who asks for his hand in a dance; he’s able to get out of her that she saw someone pass by whose face was welting up like my hand did when touching the temporal fluid</li>
<li>The waitress RR was talking to suddenly walks towards him; he keeps an eye on her but goes towards Jett for safety; he talks to da Vinci while signaling to Jett that their perp is on the move and following RR</li>
<li>the waitress goes up to them and suggests a drink called the Hurlabur…</li>
<li>the waitress, Gretchen Wilder (who RR recognizes from Chrono-Co), pulls aside Hurlabur and says she’s a Watcher, who’s on a mission to make sure a thief (Fetuchini) gets caught and that Hurlabur is not to interfere (she gave da Vinci wine to make him forget conversations with RR and Jett)</li>
<li>Ace wants to launch the violent contingency plan and Damien says to wait until I’m preoccupied so I can’t stop them (Damien wants to kidnap Piere Medici and the injured waiter to get info); he straight up tells everyone but me about Plan B (makes sense, they’re Knights)</li>
<li>Damien refuses to contact backup cause he wants his boss to be proud of him for doing a good job; they all talk in the bathroom (Simon, Ace, Damien and Jett) and someone walks in on them and for some reason they all take psychic damage and Jett gets hurled out of the body of Linguini who is now freaking out</li>
<li>Something goes of, a bomb was hurled into the bathroom; Hurlabur sees the waitress clutch her head and turn to the bathroom; Jasper (who was sent as a drone) sees what looks like a heat wave, which gives RR a headache; they hear footsteps running away from the bathroom door</li>
<li>RR sees the person running away from the bathroom and gives chase (they have scars and a minor aura of purple); they blend into the crowd and RR tries to catch them</li>
<li>Hurlabur made the presence aware to the rest of us, and I feel a purple pulse from above</li>
<li>Breacher screams in Jett’s ear about goddamn Knights always messing shit up (I feel ya)</li>
<li>Fetuchini slinks off, Scar Face (temp name) target runs up to the third floor and calls it out to us; Scar drops something on his run up</li>
<li>I’m able to get up a floor and try to grab the item but it causes mental damage (14) as I see a vision of myself in the building; everything is on fire…</li>
<li>A thief is talking to Giles, and Giles slinks off while the thief travels to the center</li>
<li>Ace in a desperate attempt called to all mercenaries to chase after a suspect and they did and started beating them with sticks</li>
<li>Scar guy is running towards the bed chambers with Hurl in pursuit</li>
<li>Watchers might be gassing the place cause god knows we made a ruckus</li>
<li>Damien and Simon are in combat trying to throw their temporal watches at the target to trap him</li>
<li>Ace asks me to hold my hand out, and he transforms into a rifle; I take the shot and the guy takes 14 damage</li>
<li>The people on the upper floor follow the guy into a child’s room, Piere’s room; in the desk is a hand towel with “L.R.S.” stamped on, as well as a kaleidoscope, bullet casings from the 20th century</li>
<li>”you see an 8 year old child hiding in the closet, and he’s holding an uzi” - sam</li>
<li>I see tons of signs of purple but no sign of what was supposed to be in the case; I see a little box, a time capsule that was recently discharged (its empty)</li>
<li>Ace jumps back through the Engine with his hostage and notices the whole center is on red alert; no one is to leave; Hurl has Piere Medeci, the child</li>
<li>Hurl tries to take the waitress but another Watcher stops him</li>
<li>Jett and Breacher find a slip of paper saying “the game is afoot” with coordinates saying to meet in 1888</li>
<li>Ace’s hostage who was severely injured died before interrogation</li>
<li>We go into Hurl’s pocket dimension that looks like an Amazon warehouse; we’re here to get info out of the child (who claims to be “old as time itself”)</li>
<li>I get stabbed by the child trying to check its pulse and get downed cause it did 5 health and I was on 4 (I was stabilized but I’m unconscious at this point)</li>
<li>we deduce the time traveler is using a Receptacle to inhabit the body of the child</li>
<li>I question why they took over Piere and they said the body was a perfect body to get to a drop off point to deliver something, and that its been delivered so nothing matters</li>
<li>”Piere” says he hates Watchers cause they tell him what to do, and his “list” might’ve been rushed and roundabout but it’ll get to where it needs to go</li>
<li>Ace stabs Piere and even “Piere” is like ‘wtf man you’re stabbing a kid’</li>
<li>He admits there are three “traitors”, one of which is dead (scar man, the one Ace had hostage); he doesn’t know the others, though he does know storms are coming (specifically Ace for stabbing him twice); he says he doesn’t want to destroy timelines, but rather make them better (hence him being shocked by Ace stabbing Piere’s body)</li>
<li>He sent some pages to various locations</li>
<li>”Piere” starts prodding me about Watchers, about how we’re all wrong, and gives me coordinates to check out</li>
<li>Widgen Giles appears (the waitress who turned out to be a Watcher) and tells us about the facility being on lockdown cause a Council member was murdered… we don’t know who until next time…
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="session-2-watchers">Session 2: Watchers</h1>
<ul>
<li>me and the fellow Watchers congregate (Marlow MacPherson, Miri, and Morgan Ilkay) to address the situation at the Watchtower</li>
<li>Morgan has various chemicals on them from experiments, and are trying to investigate</li>
<li>Watchers are piling in but no Councilmembers are present (our Watcher head Madame E. should be here… presumably they’re all at the council)</li>
<li>Marlow has a cane and is sporting an ancient Egyptian battle uniform cause he didn’t have time to change after his mission (I did lmao); he’s sporting a big grin</li>
<li>Morgan notices my “main character energy” and we lock eyes</li>
<li>Miri has a note from her sister (Seline), a fellow Watcher, who said to meet there and pack something (no sign of the sister); Miri is 13 and very new to all of this</li>
<li>Miri approaches Morgan and asks about her sister’s whereabouts (“why is there a toddler in the Watcher Tower during a crisis scenario?”)</li>
<li>someone walks to the front, Larry Morton (I know him…); he has casual attire and is out of place for a Watcher; he breaks the news to us all</li>
<li>”fiddly diddly, how do I break this to you all? Uh, there’s been a murder!” - Morton</li>
<li>there’s been a murder and two people have gone missing; Minutewoman Tasha Tenison is dead, and Inspector Seline (Miri’s sister) is MIA while being suspected of having done the shot; Madame E. is also MIA</li>
<li>a Chrono-Co councilor was the witness, but the chamber is closed</li>
<li>we suspect a scarred man, the one from my mission, was behind the info stealing and is related to this shooting</li>
<li>I notice Morgan reacting to the image of the scarred man</li>
<li>Miri is training as a Watcher but her sister is the reason she’s here, she wasn’t supposed to be present at the Watchtower; Marlow points out how strange it is that Seline would commit a shooting and then summon her little sister… Miri is confident Seline didn’t do it, and wishes to proclaim her innocence</li>
<li>Morgan knows Selina from being debriefed by her earlier; Morgan notes that she seemed the same way she always does</li>
<li>Morgan works with Jane Doe, though the rest of us are more secretive; Miri’s Councilor is her sister</li>
<li>”child labor’s a social construct” - nikita</li>
<li>we are having a will reading for Tasha and a Council meeting; I don’t hesitate to attend the meeting</li>
<li>The Clown, me and MacPherson’s suspect, has broken glasses and is a short woman named Izzy; I am not aware of her identity</li>
<li>Holly Holland, a Brit, is in a fuss over what happened; she is the witness, and a man in a cloak is present looking at his watch; a Knight intelligence officer Tilda Clinton is being dragged off; she seems to be crying, and is told to get herself together; I glance at Hurlabur</li>
<li>Holly rambles but does reveal that a woman in blue with purple hair (a protege of Madame E.) faced Tasha, who had something outstretched in her hand, and the Watcher shot Tasha and picked up what she was holding; a capsule or spyglass of sorts, before running off; Madame E. disappeared</li>
<li>Breacher interrupts Hurlabur’s conversation with Holly as a rep of the Minutemen to inquire on the death</li>
<li>Morgan inquires on the gun type used, and is a handgun that can be held in one hand; she recommends going to Regina, a gun expert (Hurlabur recognizes her as someone who is never on time)</li>
<li>the whole time Engima has been listening in silence, unnoticed</li>
<li>Tracker is here for some reason</li>
<li>Jane Doe may have had access to the info that was stolen from the Watchtower</li>
<li>Seline was last seen slipping through the Time Chamber, and Holly ponders how Barney would’ve let her through</li>
<li>Holly recalls the face of Seline seemed the same but she didn’t get the clearest look (and she realizes Miri is her sister); Miri recounts that Seline acted fine the last few days</li>
<li>Holly mentions security footage that we can look through</li>
<li>The Clown’s Councillor David Gallaway is present (he didn’t see anything); Gallaway mentions that you can’t hop through Watchtowers as its blocked, at least that we know of…</li>
<li>Seline supposedly committed the murder after entering as normal; the security guards recognized her so she was granted access; a guard recalls she walked in a bit after Tasha</li>
<li>Morgan calls Barney and he says he never saw her come in, so she didn’t exit through the Central Watch Tower which should be impossible</li>
<li>the only people who left in between the murder time windows was a group made of Breacher, the Clown, Jett, Mr. Time and Marlow</li>
<li>Breacher talks to the cloaked wizard guy; he mentions Tasha had many friends and enemies, including maybe Breacher himself; Tasha wasn’t supposed to die, and the rats this guy talks to heard Tasha desperately pleading; a rat crawls through Breacher and we realize he’s a hologram; the guy says that someone wanted to mess with Tasha’s people and that she “won”; she played a game but lost 2-22; the Lord Commander; Rachel Anderson spoke of beasts of steel; the meeting was adjourned when something went down in Florence Italy… our mission caused emergencies back at HQ; Doe and Clinton were elected but a third Chrono-Co is unknown; Dalton will settle a score</li>
<li>Morgan tries to cold case one of the rats and upon contact he sees Tasha saying “please Seline” over and over, while the gun figure’s hand shakes as they say “i don’t want to do this”; Tasha is confused before she is shot</li>
<li>in other convos tasha talks of “the end” and other cryptid allusions to something going down</li>
<li>We go to Province Park and review footage; it shows that Seline didn’t go to the Engine but towards the Minutemen markets (where their HQ is, along with black market type areas); there’s a Receptacle den there</li>
<li>Tasha was a respected Councilmember from a faction that’s not really a faction; she had a decent estate, not like a rich person though; she had offices and such</li>
<li>Enrique, a Councilor, reads the will; her money is going to helping temporal refugees; Selene is willed an estate, and &ldquo;in Selene&rsquo;s absence, her portion of the inheritance goes to Miri&rdquo; (not even death…); a sweatshirt is willed to Tilda, a sculptor of a frog to Two Horn of the Forest, and Rachel Anderson gets a watch (a normal one)</li>
<li>Alek Wilde said Tasha was like family and he was dedicated to protecting her; the Knights didn’t seem to like her; Breacher knows the Clown; Tasha spoke highly of Clinton; Tasha had a handkerchief with L.R.S. on it…</li>
<li>Some Councilor was in on this, because whatever was stolen wasn’t even in the Archives; the other general documents were encrypted and shipped away; Alek suspects the burglary was a distraction as some things were shipped off to Italy…</li>
<li>”Don’t ask about the drugging of Leonardo da Vinci” - me
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="session-3-zephyrs-lab">Session 3: Zephyr’s Lab</h1>
<ul>
<li>I’ve been compiling Archives info while Morgana has been following the murder trail; Damien has been doing “classic Knight stuff”</li>
<li>Damien and I were called for a meeting; we see Lord Commander McEntire and Tilda Clinton (she deals with external threats, McEntire deals with internal security typically); McEntire summoned us specifically and asked for my Watcher expertise</li>
<li>The murder happened the same day as the theft… the item we were tracking had an extra 36 hours that wasn’t accounted for, enough time for the briefcase to be cracked; McEntire suspects Hemlock; the scar man stole the item in between when we lost it in florence and when the egypt squad acquired it</li>
<li>We are showed the scarred man from florence, tho morgan recognizes it a the scarred man she met from greece mission; he is an operative and stole the stuff from an insider job regarding chrono-co</li>
<li>a second photo of another scarred man exactly matches the guy from the greece mission, and he was working with hemlock in greece</li>
<li>Hemlock scarred man is from greece, secondhand scarred man is from florence; both are alive despite the secondhand being supposedly killed; he woke up only speaking spanish</li>
<li>case went directly from florence to egypt, and there’s a suspected spy from the egypt group</li>
<li>secondhand is under watcher custody, and hemlock guy is in Knight custody</li>
<li>as damien and I exit, leaning against the wall is Morgana; I recognize them from the meeting; Morgana wishes to work together, and though I am hard pressed, them revealing themself to be a Watcher and having been present on the Greece trip I relent</li>
<li>Tracker suddenly comes up and joins our brigade</li>
<li>apparently Damien is applying for Councilship, or Creel wants him to anyway</li>
<li>something about a “Basement 7” that Damien and Tracker have for interrogation; its not plot relevant just funny</li>
<li>We travel to the hemlock scarred man in Knights custody; Clinton is speaking to him and he is rambling and cackling; Clinton is tired and is clearly overworked</li>
<li>Clinton says he keeps mentioning “Hemlock” and “the plan”</li>
<li>Damien plans for us to extract info by using secret identities; I am very done but I do consider it as a way to plant a tracker (its ok if he escapes, I just need to track him)</li>
<li>Morgana warns that this guy is prepared, and there’s a chance he would not fall for a fake break out</li>
<li>We plan that Tracker and Morgana will do good cop-bad cop and Damien and I pretend to break Hemlock guy out when they signal for us</li>
<li>Tracker is apparently part opossum… and part dog</li>
<li>the code word is “chocolate croissant”</li>
<li>the two scarred men don’t know about each other; we must prevent a paradox</li>
<li>Florence was the one who stole items, Greece caused the downfall of Athenian democracy</li>
<li>In the Watchtower two copies of the same person shouldn’t be able to exist at the same time; Watchtower has two recorded exits for these timelines, one to Florence and one slightly later to Greece</li>
<li>Morgana begins interrogation; Greece says the “8 step plan for world domination” is in place; step one is trickery and is done, step 2 “has happened now, or will happen now”</li>
<li>Morgana finds he doesn’t know anything about Tuhorn, and that a Watcher died (who he’s tight lipped on); he says “we all die, or we don’t, or we do”; its possible this dead Watcher hasn’t died yet</li>
<li>”when the sky turns red, and the dinosaurs rain from above, you will see it”; he then asks about Ronald Reagan and I guess he doesn’t like Ronald Reagan or plans to kill him??? Idfk</li>
<li>Greece’s group is the “snake in our boot” we’ve forgotten about</li>
<li>Greece says his group was behind three Watchtower incidents, “the hand, man behind the curtain”</li>
<li>Florence was in a good mental state supposedly before he died, and how he is now is unknown</li>
<li>Morgana chews out Simon for fucking up the Florence mission (i love them)</li>
<li>”those that have risen shall fall and those who have fallen shall rise” necromancy?</li>
<li>”our new leaders might not be who we think they are”</li>
<li>”step away from the Time Man”</li>
<li>he fucks around and toys with us about potentially lying</li>
<li>Greece inquires that Morgana is “Enigma, isn’t it?”; Morgana quiet messages me that they know my name and I could be walking into a trap</li>
<li>Morgana wants to do a cold case of the other scarred man (Florence) but seeing as he was revived she is hesitant; it might fuck up the timeline</li>
<li>Morgana cold cases back to the Watchtower to three and a half days in the past, from Greece’s perspective; she takes some temp damage and she notices he’s in a morgue somewhere; someone dressed in clown makeup looks at him; he runs and is tackled before being taken into Watcher custody; she sees that what’s happening to Greece is what the reports showed as having happened to Florence, and those reports came from earlier today while Morgana traveled four days in the past (something supposedly happened to him six hours ago in his personal timeline based on the reports)</li>
<li>three days ago Greece was doing something that Florence did six hours ago; this breaks Watchtower consistency, it shouldn’t be possible</li>
<li>Greece says we have to stop things not before they happen, but as they happen, and then before they happen</li>
<li>Morgana uses the code, and Damien comes in guns blazing; I knock out Tracker, and me and Damien run out with Greece</li>
<li>”step 7 is the step of destiny, but your destiny ends here”</li>
<li>As we escape, I successfully plant my tracker</li>
<li>he asks my name and I say my name is Coran; Damien puts on a whole show (Derek Beautywolf Tracker cause he’s stupid) and convinces him, though he is suspicious of me; Damien demands the secret evil handshake (he might’ve planted a tracker cause he did some weird movements lmao)</li>
<li>Damien asks what step we’re on, and Greece insinuates we’re all on different steps; he mentions a strange clown messed up his watch and he can travel through his old self but not his new (by three days); he has three days of future insight to cause chaos</li>
<li>Damien makes us to the handshake (he “slowly, almost sensually” dabs up Simon)</li>
<li>We head to the CTE, and I am able to extract that “Morgana and Breacher are onto me”</li>
<li>Damien dramatically reveals that he is Damien Balewolf, and that we tricked him; the walls of Damien’s temporal prison fall around us and we are back in the room</li>
<li>Simon reviews security footage and sees that the guy we’re with now came from the time labs, and another guy came from the Council; Florence supposedly got resurrected from the Clown</li>
<li>Watchtower chronicler reveals Zephyr is looking for applications for people who’ve experienced grief</li>
<li>We go to the Time Lab, and it all seems shut down and closed off; we enter with Damien leading (or he would but Morgana stops him as he’s a nerd; I take the lead with Damien at my heels)</li>
<li>Morgana has Damien keep watch while me and Enigma look to enter; Damien tried jumping over and got a Nat 1 and got electrocuted by the security doors</li>
<li>Morgana unlocks the mainframe and Simon hacks open the gate</li>
<li>A steel barricade that dropped down in the past blocks the way; Simon checks the logs and sees that the barricade dropped about a day ago (after our journey started and after Tasha’s murder)</li>
<li>I attempt to hack a door and fail with a 6 and Simon attempts to hack it and fails with a 6</li>
<li>As Damien tries making a plan, I use my Temporal Teleportation to open a door and walk through; Damien on instinct follows me but Morgana outpaces him cause she’s a hater (-4 charges for our group, 4 left)</li>
<li>We enter, and Damien’s sword light shines on a hunched figure shaking and rocking back and forth; as they start twitching, a figure on the floor also starts twitching, and purple aura leaks from them; they attack Damien</li>
<li>They scream “who are you?!” as they lunge; their face is decaying</li>
<li>Damien goes “look its the scarred man, their faces are scarred!” and is met by our disappointed silence</li>
<li>Morgana shouts to incapacitate not kill; Damien slices his sword laser and incinerates the being</li>
<li>The second being shrieks “monster” and attacks Damien; Simon tries to tackle it but fails; I do a drop and swipe its legs from under it knocking it down (9 BABY, 12 W/ MODS)</li>
<li>Damien uses his temporal prison to trap it so we have one, but we hear shrieks down the hall</li>
<li>A voice from the intercomms reaches out to us and an eccentric voice says he’s trapped on Sublevel 3 and directs us to the rooms; mystery man, Dr. Zephyr, tells us not to kill them as its not effective (though the creatures are weak to energy weapons)</li>
<li>First sublevel has weapons which is where we head (we all succeed thank fuck); temporal is also useful, but there’s three or so more creature and a dog in our way</li>
<li>Zephyr mentions decay level can indicate if the individual is dead as “some of them weren’t dead when they entered”; we need to spare the living “zombies” as they are still people</li>
<li>The dog attacks Simon and he uses a shield to block it</li>
<li>Three zombies rush to me, but I brush past them with ease… I teleport (-1 charge) and brute strength open the door</li>
<li>Zephyr’s voice cracks to life and informs me that temporal weapons are good for “curing” while energy is good for killing</li>
<li>I see a lightning launcher (energy), temp nova launcher (physical) and a three shots physical damage for temp; I take the Three Shots as its the only temporal weapon and we need it to cure (and a boat load of energy tasers and batons)</li>
<li>Damien is killing all zombies regardless of it they’re alive or not</li>
<li>A zombie blocks my way but I run past (after failing to get it with an energy baton and after it fails to kill me) and toss weapons to anyone who needs them, keeping the temporal gun and an energy baton for myself; I shout to only kill the withered ones as I’ll handle the living with my temp gun</li>
<li>Z4 is on Morgana, Z2 the withered is in the back, and a dog is on Simon; 4 more are coming down the stairs</li>
<li>I see with my Timey Sense that some of these things are pink while others are purple</li>
<li>Morgana uses a taser and disintegrates the dog; Z4 moans warnings which means they’re still not fully infected</li>
<li>Damien can’t tell which is which and proceeds to kill 3, one of which was alive and Zephyr’s intern</li>
<li>At this point Anu had to leave and instructed that I roleplay him</li>
<li>Simon takes down a withered, and i use the temp gun on Z4 who was alive and blast their ass with my Vicious Shot to “cure” them; I instruct Damien to carry them to the weapon’s room for safety per Zephyr’s instruction</li>
<li>We run down to Zephyr’s and see a pod; Zephyr is inside, with 6 zombies clawing around the pod he’s in; he waves at us, and asks us to not damage anything else</li>
<li>3 withered, 3 normal; Morgana shouts at the horde that anyone who wants to live should move to the side; three of the zombies halt and stumble about, they’re the alive; the withered charge us</li>
<li>Morgana uses the energy chain gun from the weapons room she picked up earlier and instakills 2 of the withered, one withered breaches and rushes Simon, downing him</li>
<li>The three normies rush us, and i use the temp gun to hit and down two of them; one normie and one wither remain, rushing us</li>
<li>Morgana uses the a taser on the last wither, and I use the temp gun on the last normie; Morgana brings back up Simon, and Zephyr’s pod pops open as he exits</li>
<li>Zephyr whips up some traps with temporal energy, and as zombies descend the stairs, Zephyr lets Somin do the honors of pushing the big red detonator; the withered disintegrate, while the normies scream in pain but remain alive and rid of temporal energy</li>
<li>Zephyr airily says there is no need to report this “little mishap”, though me and Morgana are more moral</li>
<li>Zephyr doesn’t recall anyone entering the building, but we go through his security footage (his thank you for our work)</li>
<li>Morgana sees footage of the scarred man leaving the lab, despite no footage of him entering; Zephyr says this should be impossible unless the quasi-temporal process used a pad to provide a jump point that could bypass Watchtower regulations; he came from the third sublevel, and Zephyr deduces the man must have been reanimated</li>
<li>I say that we can sweep the whole zombie thing under the rug and he works with us and keeps it all private; we tell him details about the corpse</li>
<li>Zephyr has heard of Simon upgrades his arm; I have to stop Simon from yapping too many details to the mad scientist from Chrono-Co</li>
<li>Zephyr speaks of taking the mind out right before it dies and placing it in another body, so its the same person with a different body; sam proceeded to give a shit ton of details that Vivien will have; an R is a mind transferer, and in this case it is being stored</li>
<li>if a person’s mind gets R’d, their body is left behind and could upset the CTE clock</li>
<li>Theory 1:</li>
<li>Theory 2: someone dies (say 2024), and you revive them but instead of pulling their current mind and putting it back into their body, you pulled their past mind from say 2023 and put that in the current body; the mystery is how would you be able to retrieve that past mind?</li>
<li>We strong arm him into letting us keep the weapons (on the promise that rather than get his operations closed down entirely we would have his work be more regulated)</li>
<li>Zephyr points us to Jake Robertson (research assistant of someone, possibly Tasha or Tuhorn); he is the scarred man, a former chrono-co employee sent by either lighthorn or tuhorn to steal the Watchtower info</li>
<li>The news reveals that Greece escaped…
Mission Success, Session End
OBJECTIVES: track the coord from “Pierre”, interrogate Florence, question the Clown, question Jake Robertson</li>

<h1 id="session-35-new-yorkturkey">Session 3.5: New York/Turkey</h1>
<h1 id="-not-my-session-but-i-was-here">-(not my session but I was here)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Group of Breacher (Bryce), The Clown (), Mr. Time (), Brad (Sabrina),</li>
<li>this group have been chasing down the Secondhand Revolution; the Knights are not in the best position due to the time war, and no one really likes them; Lord Commander McEntire has hired this group to help with a catastrophic timeline change; majority of forces are working with Creel so we’re stretched for people</li>
<li>The Clown I learn is sort of aloof; and she likes Doctor Who; she might be Chrono-Co?</li>
<li>Mr. Time mentions his memory was wiped; he’s also a dedicated Chrono-Co member</li>
<li>The Clown brought “the communist” (Greece/Florence) back to life; Breacher chews her out, and mentions he was possessed by some Cuban revolutionary at some point</li>
<li>I am once again reminded Breacher is a hologram</li>
<li>The Funny Gun is what was used to bring Flo/Greece back</li>
<li>The Clown has cats</li>
<li>Clown mentions he and Mr. Time have a coworker (a frog, undoubtedly Hurlabur)</li>
<li>They finally notice I’ve been listening by the wall, The Clown tries to talk to me and I simply glare (I also side-eye Breacher)</li>
<li>Breacher mentions his campaign manager wants him to make connections to the Knights</li>
<li>I learn the Clown dislikes politics and is a very “all parties suck” kinda person; she’s running because why not (to make a mockery most likely)</li>
<li>I learn Mr. Time, Breacher and the Clown are all running for elections (two Chrono, one Minuteman, though the Clown isn’t very loyal to anything)</li>
<li>Clown summoned Galloway to help fight for them in some instance I wasn’t there for as he’s her Councilor, but this is an odd thing to happen where the protegee summons a Councilor…</li>
<li>Breacher is very firm in wanting to represent the Minutemen, and she dislikes Chrono-Co</li>
<li>&ldquo;Underwater basket-weaving is the sole cause of climate change&rdquo; - The Clown</li>
<li>Brad enters the group, and he is very hot (if Ken was even more dumb and hot); he’s a Watcher but as like a cleaner, he’s the Help because he’s so dumb; he was summoned to help me cause I’m the competent one</li>
<li>We enter a chamber with Lord McEntire who’s looking at info; Breacher calls him an asshole and they have beef ig</li>
<li>Creel is off fighting the war on other fronts and McEntire has detected two or three signals; an effect in 1916, a fight between the Russians and Ottoman Empire has been affected; this creates a ripple in 1962 in Washington D.C.; we must jump through both</li>
<li>In the eastern front of the Great War things were more mobile with tanks and less trench warfare; we likely won’t see any planes since they were made at the end of the war so if we do its a scout or something’s wrong; a Hemlock agent dropped something around this area that created a ripple; we must deal with it</li>
<li>There’s a third world war and a 2.5 we don’t talk about (not important but funny)</li>
<li>McEntire hands me a device so we can communicate with him in real time; its a time capsule where we can put written communication (like in Umbrella Academy)</li>
<li>We head to the CTE while Clown explains to Brad what World War I is (he doesn’t know)</li>
<li>Mr. Time wants to make propaganda of him saving people in WW1; he also wants to make Brad a wrist model</li>
<li>I talk to Brad and realize he’s an idiot so I tell him to follow my lead; I also tell him timeline maintaining is of utmost importance</li>
<li>As we head to the CTE we run into fucking Tracker so he’s with us now</li>
<li>We meet with Barney and can either go to Russian front 1916 or D.C. 1962; Barney sees that Hemlock jumped causing a minor strain in 1916 that snowballs in 1962 with massive temporal disruption; one guy went to investigate but he disappeared, there’s an agent in this time who runs a local newspaper who we can find for details (Jeff O’Hailey)</li>
<li>Barney tells Clown he’s rather die than see her as a Councilor (she turned Shakespeare into a frog apparently, after turning him into a duck; she also had an incident in the 50’s; Barney tells her to stay away from spicy foods)</li>
<li>Barney says we have a new Receptacle tracking system; we can use 5 numbers to correspond to watch attributes for calculations (our stats)</li>
<li>I give Brad a stern talk about our TRUE mission, maintaining the timeline at all costs</li>
<li>October 1962; I sport an era-appropriate trenchcoat</li>
<li>Clown has a fake ID for “Hillary Millary”, and gives us all one</li>
<li>Brad flexes and his outfit tears; I aggressively put a trenchcoat on him and as the Clown questions Brad’s mental capacity we are beamed</li>
<li>We’re in the capital, and Breacher entrusts me with the briefcase holding his drone tech to carry around; I ask him to look after Brad on the side</li>
<li>The Clown jokingly calls me goofy and it takes everything to not lunge and kill her</li>
<li>Mr. Time picks up a newspaper that says “President orders naval quarantine of Cuba”; the date is Oct 27, today’s date; we look into that era and see it was a height for the Cuban Missile Crisis; Moscow removed missiles from Turkey and they were sent to D.C.; US plane is shot down and pilot Maya Rudolph Anderson is killed; Kennedy calls for removal of missiles from Moscow; outside of Cuba there’s a submarine crisis</li>
<li>Brad thinks the cold war happening during the Ice Age</li>
<li>Breacher deduces that the Ottoman Empire situation which was between Turkey and Russia has to do with the missile crisis now between the two</li>
<li>We look for Jeff O’Hale who works for the Washington Post</li>
<li>Breacher’s Receptacle is spying on the president</li>
<li>We head to Kay street and walk into the office saying we have an app with O’Hale</li>
<li>Time has some mind control abilities that let us through (“time is money”)</li>
<li>We go to O’Hale and are attacked with temporal damage (I take 2); O’Hale also takes this damage and rushes us in</li>
<li>There’s been temporal disruptions; O’Hale, or the Sentinel, says he can’t find much around here and that its all normal in D.C. despite us getting our signal from here at the CTE; this timeline isn’t supposed to exist and its not the one we’re protecting</li>
<li>the missile crisis is heading as it should, and we should head to the whitehouse for more info; its possible the disturbance hasn’t happened yet</li>
<li>O’Hale says this timeline is to be wiped out after we’ve fixed things</li>
<li>Anything that’s public facing seems to be normal; what’s to happen either hasn’t happened or is happening behind closed doors</li>
<li>I ask him about the missing agent that was dispatched and he says he was that agent; he’s confused why his presence was noted as missing, and we realize its because the temporal disturbances interfered with his ability to communicate with HQ, and that he was to die from whatever is to happen (we suspect its a missile launch); we tell O’Hale such and he leaves to avoid getting killed</li>
<li>Since I can teleport, I am to go to the White House to investigate; as we talk, we hear sirens</li>
<li>Clown has secret service costumes on hand and we walk up to the WH with our disguises and forged IDs; Brad’s charisma saves us from scrutiny by the guards and we enter</li>
<li>There’s no sign of Kennedy and certain individuals are being led down a bunker</li>
<li>Clown is able to pass security to go to the Oval Office and take notes</li>
<li>We see Kennedy and he’s being pulled down stairs to a bunker; Clown tells him god saves america in her wacky way and draws her Funny Gun; Kennedy starts speaking in Russian and calls us capitalist bastards</li>
<li>Clown jumps and we all get 6 temporal damage</li>
<li>I try to rush through the agents who are on high alert from “the president being a communist” and Clown having shot at said president and exited</li>
<li>I am stopped but Brad sweet talks his way to the guards so we can get to the OO but it fails; I order Brad to distract them and I time jump to the OO as Brad flexes (-1)</li>
<li>Mr. Time gets down to the bunker to secure us spots</li>
<li>I jump to the OO and lock the door; Breacher (whose drone is with me) and I take in note info (BOTH OF US GOT NAT12 LETS FUCKING GO)</li>
<li>i findthat a nuke torpedo was launched from a Russian sub that hit a naval blockade; the US navy nearby started firing to intercept but it didn’t work, and Cuba nearby started firing at our mainland in response; the US then gave the go to fire Turkish missiles</li>
<li>Breacher finds that this sub was in a standoff for a while from call logs; its unclear if the sub was in contact with Moscow, but we have the sub info to look through when we return to HQ</li>
<li>Brad gets into the bunker, and I tp in (-1); Kennedy is still fucked up and screaming in Russian; breacher’s receptacle sees the nukes go off before he jumps to HQ</li>
<li>We get to the Watchtower and I am furious at the Clown; I punch her (8 baby) and she looks hurt; we are locked in a heated argument and some think I should be nicer but none of them stopped me from doing it lmao; Clown and I hate each other, and I storm off (fuck non-Watchers)</li>
<li>Jett is waiting for us at the CTE; he uses his smartwatch to contact a Julia, who is at the site of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and she reports a nuke hit a little too close to the Russian sub; the top three commanders voted and one said no, which is why they didn’t retaliate; this was the timeline that was supposed to happen, where the nukes don’t go off; Jett deduces in 1916 the ancestor of the commander who said no was killed causing the ripple</li>
<li>we find that this ancestor was a Russian peasant who fought in the war and at the battle that’s our point</li>
<li>We had to use a TU to jump back to the CTE so that’s -1</li>
<li>Brad has to find me and despite my anger, he’s able to gently reason with me that as much as I hate working with the Clown (who I see as a threat from my work with Marlow), we have a job and I should go to make sure that it doesn’t go poorly (as a Watcher)</li>
<li>At this point the Chrono-Co people were pulled aside and Ace shows up (fucking Manav); I tell him “no” and go to the corner to seethe</li>
<li>Jett opens up about his backstory and says his wife was blown up in a car bomb and he got wrapped up in time stuff before joining (he’s from the 70s)</li>
<li>Ace introduces himself and I have my gun back</li>
<li>Clown comes back from her private meeting without the Funny Gun</li>
<li>We decide what we’re going to do; I publicly apologize for my prior outburst, and promise to do better (I am not sorry for punching the Clown just for losing my cool)</li>
<li>Ace gets snippy with me cause he’s a bastard and we already don’t get along</li>
<li>We are sent back, and we see the Russians are about to launch a naval and ground assault on Turkish soil; we’re in the trenches on the side of the Russians</li>
<li>Breacher gives us a rundown; 4 guys. a captain, Isaac Morosov, Breacher’s being Abraham, and a tank</li>
<li>Arkapov is the guy we’re protecting; Tracker pipes up from a radio to convince him to move from the area</li>
<li>Mr. Time gets a call from someone with spiky blue hair and a weird smile on his smart watch; they are Malikai von Spatz, the one I am pursuing; he is with Hemlock, and wishes to destroy us; he says they sent more than one assassin</li>
<li>Mr. Time and Spatz have history, and they’re enemies; Mr. Time says he doesn’t know the guy</li>
<li>Breacher sends a cam drone to scout for these assassins but can’t find anything; Breacher says all the Receptacles he has of the people in Arkapov’s unit are supposed to die except for the mechanic</li>
<li>I use my Timey Sense to see that no one in our camp is an assassin</li>
<li>Jett offers cigs to soldiers and Arkapov to get some chatter going for info collecting; he lies and says Vlad is our captain (we don’t fucking have one lmao); Jett asks Arkapov is he wants children one day (it was for info but it was funny ooc</li>
<li>Sarinka, out captain, says we are doing the land assault; we are breaching a city through the outskirts; we are pushing the turks behind city lines and we have to look out for 3 major weapons</li>
<li>AC learns that the outskirts of the city might have farmers, potential assassins (also AC wants to kill people)</li>
<li>AC gets people sus and I try to fix it but I fail the roll so I’m sus and Jett tries to fix it but HE’S sus; Clown cackles</li>
<li>The captain then calls us idiots, and she reveals herself as Widgeon Gyles, the Watcher from Florence</li>
<li>Another soldier is a Knight undercover, he is going to out-Receptacle soon and informs us no one from this timeline would remember this</li>
<li>We are to identify and handle assassins while Breacher sticks with Arkapov</li>
<li>Ace asks Clown if she wants to use him as a gun; she mistakes this as flirtation; I say I’ll handle Ace as I’ve used him before; she also mistakes this as a flirtation</li>
<li>We’re hitting farms and then neighborhood, which we will take control over before leaving</li>
<li>We rush forward with the assault, but Time is moving at the pace of the prior squadron who he’s supposed to be ahead of; the Clown is falling behind (Brad waits behind with him)</li>
<li>Time is pretending to be Captain Broadsky; Breacher sees 3 Turks hiding behind a barn (we’re trying to avoid killing them, we can’t kill anyone other than the Hemlock assassins)</li>
<li>we’re separated; first squadron is us time people, second squad is Mr. Time with the Russians, third is Clown and Brad falling behind with some random Russians</li>
<li>We are able to go past the Turks, they notice one of us but let us go and we carry on; we discuss cutting through the other more crowded farm areas rather than the open hills</li>
<li>Morosov (the one that is supposed to die) gets shot up in the second squad and Sarinka orders they get down; Breacher’s drone annihilates a tank</li>
<li>Clown and Mr. Time do a photo shoot of Time with the battle in the background for propaganda</li>
<li>On the hillside Breacher’s drone sees behind some cover… white fur? It snipes the drone, and it comes from the 22 century</li>
<li>Spatz chimes in again and mentions Tuhorn; he gives a poem about an agent of white fur, one of scale, and one wielding the holy grail (our targets)</li>
<li>The Clown wants to go crazy but I do stealthy; Breacher scouts with the other drone and I use 4 charges to tp to it; Ace transforms into a gun and as I tp behind it I shoot, but shit rng means all 3 shots miss</li>
<li>I get attacked and take 12 mental damage; i have 8 health</li>
<li>I shoot again at the Yedi and give it some damage but its not enough; Ace tells me to throw him at it so I do and Ace attacks, but the Yedi hits him aside</li>
<li>the Yedi slams into Ace several times; I tell Ace to turn into a gun so I can grab him and flee, we signal to Clown and Clown fires shells that destroy the Yeti (I rolled two w/ advantage to get out of the way and got a Nat 9 and Nat 12)</li>
<li>Akripov’s squad pushes forward to deal with enemies while we hide around (Breacher’s got eyes on Arkipov); one Hemlock down, two to go</li>
<li>Clown fixes Breacher’s other drone; the Russian’s armored car is getting fucked but is going still</li>
<li>Russians inform we need to take the trench line, and we are instructed to go with the center assault</li>
<li>Breacher’s drone fails to detect anything; Jett doesn’t get any useful info from Julia</li>
<li>Our path is a road with alleys that branch off; me with Ace and Time go in the alleys, Clown, Brad and Breacher stick with Arkipov (Jett had to leave)</li>
<li>Some random Chrono-Co dude gets Rec’d into a Turk that blocks our path by Time and is a Time fanboy who gets his autograph</li>
<li>Brad sees an armored car that has the scales of justice on it… that’s our Hemlock agent; they shoot at Arkipov but miss, and almost kills Breacher’s Receptacle (he would’ve died anyway but best to take down the enemy first)</li>
<li>Breacher’s Rec is about done so she charges the Hemlock vehicle and sticks a grenade into the wheel; it gives damage and her Rec dies</li>
<li>Brad shoots his machine gun at the armored vehicle; Clown throws a grenade</li>
<li>The door opens of the vehicle and a scaly green arm pokes out; before Arkipov can see too much Breacher releases his smokescreen to obscure everyone’s vision; it was still his turn so he just threw a grenade at it</li>
<li>Ace as a gun waiting for me to shoot readies actions; I can’t see anything in the fog and I failed by Timey Sense roll so the smoke is obscuring; I shoot and hit but only one shot and he’s still alive</li>
<li>Brad fired his machine gun and finished off the agent; Breacher uses his abilities to bring down the smoke screen and make the agent seem like a normal person to the others (not our squad)</li>
<li>There’s some goons I help shoot down (we could kill these without consequence); these goons are op</li>
<li>We have one more agent to kill and the two in our squad who were set to live are alive; at this point we’ve won the battle, the Russians are celebrating but we have one more agent left</li>
<li>Tracker informs us the disturbance is still active, but that its reporting to happen later that night; we decide to leave to recharge and get our bearings before hopping back to around the time</li>
<li>I try to duck into an alley after Ace leaves so I can transport back to the CTE, but in the alley is a Knight; I demand to know who they are and why they’re in this time period; they say they’re lost in an uncanny voice as they walk towards me… they ask where the Holy Grail is. I’ve found the last agent, and I’m alone in the alley</li>
<li>I charge them with my energy baton from Zephyr (good rolls!, all above 12), and though Breacher tries to help me with his drones the Knight charges me and I am downed (I’m on death saves, I fail 2 and I’m dead)</li>
<li>As I’m hit again while downed, the squad arrives (Brad, Clown, Time and Breacher); Clown rushes to me and protects me, Breacher holograms three look alikes of me on the ground to confuse the Knight, which successfully tricks the Knight for a turn so it attacks the wrong me</li>
<li>Clown brings me up to 10hp</li>
<li>Breacher creates holograms of us; I fail a hit and lend my baton to Brad who’s better at it</li>
<li>Breacher has an energy gun that I use to shoot (14 baby) and it goes down; Clown goes to tase the Knight just to make sure its down, the sword swings around and Clown dodges as we open fire; it is dead, and we head back</li>
<li>before we leave, Mr. Time gets another call from Spatz who tells him to head to the Himalayas 100BCE (he makes a snow pun)</li>
<li>We head back to the Watchtower (-1 TU) and I call Watchers to clean the mess; we are greeted by McEntire who praises us but he seems stressed by something else</li>
<li>McEntire looks to me and Ace and says Creel has been captured to the Himalayas, where dinosaurs were raining from the sky in 100BC; me and Ace are called for an urgent mission</li>
<li>Time and Clown are summoned to do Chrono-Co stuff; Breacher gets payed</li>
<li>As we part ways, Breacher approaches me and says it was a pleasure working with me; I return his gun and say despite their rep, the Minutemen are some of the most reliable people I’ve worked with and the pleasure it mine</li>
<li>I go to Brad to get my baton back but let him keep it, and say despite being new he did good work; he holds back tears and clutches the baton nodding at my praise (awww lmao)</li>
<li>Ace puts his hand on Mr. Time’s shoulder and says “i hate capitalists” before leaving
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="session-4-prehistoric-earth-apparently-it-wasnt-himalayas">Session 4: Prehistoric Earth (apparently it wasn’t Himalayas)</h1>
<ul>
<li>We begin with an emergency alert; the Knights are unaware of what’s happening and run to the barracks; Ace and I know exactly what’s happening</li>
<li>Tilda Clinton is present at the briefing, she looks tired and very stressed; Lord Commander McEntire is also present; Claric Orlaith, a new face, is present as well, she’s a Councilor</li>
<li>McEntire says he suspects a Hemlock spy is among us; I ask him why he thinks so and he says within our committees and the Council itself he suspects a spy because the Egypt mission was meant to recover info and it was never brought in, and when it was it had been tampered with 24 hours in (Egypt is Clown, Breacher, Jett, Marlow, Mr. Time and Jungwon)</li>
<li>We suspect Mr. Time is involved as there’s been mentioned of a “Time Man” by Second Hand (who might be cooperating with Hemlock)</li>
<li>Clinton says Hemlock has three agents total in the committees; they are probably in different factions</li>
<li>Cleric pipes up that Creel was taken hostage; a Hemlock stronghold in 100BC Himalayas was sieged by Creel but it was a trap so he got abducted; dinosaurs rained from the sky</li>
<li>We’re breaking into the 100BC stronghold w/ Tracker and like 18 goon NPCs; its a major mission</li>
<li>Morgana briefs us on the Jack the Ripper mission (she got the info from Breacher who was on it); Breacher told us dinosaurs rained from the sky in a mission regarding Jack the Ripper, and the dinosaurs were summoned by the Clown; Breacher also mentioned the Clown isn’t quite themself, and is possibly being controlled</li>
<li>Cleric glares at Ace as she says its possible one of us may even be a spy; she doesn’t trust Ace, and she also says all of Clinton and Creel’s missions keep failing; she says Chrono-Co offered to give robots for our missions</li>
<li>Building is four stories with multiple entrances; we must be stealthy, and potentially climb up a main wall and traverse pipes that get us in the basement; there’s also a server room that could give us a full layout (and get me my data)</li>
<li>I learn that von Spatz himself is at the stronghold; disturbances in the basement is detected even though that’s where we might pop up; Secondary target is getting Malikai, and main objective is to get Creel</li>
<li>We have on more proposed entry point; the Councilors don’t like it, but a roof drop might give access to the third floor, as well as evacuations (though anti-air defenses might be an issue)</li>
<li>Lord Commander MacIntyre I was spelling it wrong fuck me</li>
<li>I have a private convo with McEntire and learn its not actually him that keeps assigning me to the Knights, but Larry (my Councilor); he says I’m capable of keeping them together and strong, and I would make a fantastic Knight (not that I would join)</li>
<li>Damien got an 82/1600 on a test we’re so fucked (he also can’t count that high)</li>
<li>Apparently Creel threw Damien off a roof at some point</li>
<li>We plan to have the NPCs enter through the basement as a distraction and cause they’re equipped to fight without temp energy, while we scale the walls; and exit with Creel through the roof after finding the console and disabling the air defenses</li>
<li>Morgana mentions she tried to raid a Hemlock base earlier but it failed</li>
<li>Once we’re in the compound we can’t time travel, my tp ability would still work as its a temporal disruption but it may be faulty so I’ll need to be careful</li>
<li>out of session I got another energy baton, and while grouping and prep I get a normal gun (Ace gets jealous)</li>
<li>We jump back to the Himalayas and its all lava; the Hemlock base is in our sights, and our squad of 75 NPCs storms the basement while we and our 18 NPCs head for the walls</li>
<li>We see an eye of sauron ass light scanning the area</li>
<li>Damien mentions he used to have friends and they died like the NPC rushing the basement; I say that’s why you shouldn’t have friends</li>
<li>Jandro calls me an emo fuck</li>
<li>I practically plead that we all do this mission correctly and don’t cause chaos like last time; Enigma is visibly tired and has some bruises and bandages from the last mission, just a bandage or two and a black eye so nothing major but she clearly had a rough mission; Ace consoles me with a hand on my shoulder and says “I am a gun”; this was the oddest response he could’ve given</li>
<li>Since we need good tech, agility and hardiness I was the best candidate; we decide to play it safe scaling a ledge, but Damien is slipping so Ace goes to him to help him up; Tracker is also falling behind</li>
<li>I reach the vent on the wall and with a beautiful Nat 9 + 4 I make it in; everyone else makes it in accept Damien and Ace who fell behind; Damien doesn’t make it and his leg gets caught in the scan; oddly enough, the Eye doesn’t react and goes about</li>
<li>Neko, Foxtrot and Golf (our NPCs), are with us on the second floor; we pop out into a corridor, to our right is the south and a barracks chamber along that have computers (could have defenses); I don’t Time Sense anyone and Morgana doesn’t find anyone but there is a security camera</li>
<li>Damien (without telling us before cause he’s him) uses a mirror and the light from his sword to angle it at the camera and make it seem like the sunlight hitting it at a bad angle to obscure it; we look through the computers in the meantime</li>
<li>There’s propaganda posters by von Spatz to join Hemlock on the walls</li>
<li>Ace sees the computer is what controls some of the defenses; the controls are manual, tho it is still connected to a greater network</li>
<li>Damien questions why no one is guarding the gun controls, and we hope its because of our distraction</li>
<li>I fail to use the camera to identify the console, and Simon accidentally trips something in his hacking; Ace sees a generic goon looking uniform he can replicate if needed, and he does so</li>
<li>We go back into the vents and can see through the grates; goons are around and Ace in his disguise goes on the ground floor to distract them but he’s sussed outand has to bullshit (the guy sussing him is called X702 and Ace says he’s X703, who is apparently a dead guy but he’s able to pull off that he’s the dead guy who is actually alive and the files were wrong); he’s able to convince them he’s “Paul” and is summoned to deal with the basement situation (bye Ace lmao see you later when we rescue)</li>
<li>Through the vents we find the central console, though the room is full guards</li>
<li>Ace gets caught up at the elevator when his keycard doesn’t work and he’s able to bullshit that because he’s registered as dead it won’t work, which tricks the guard coming up into letting him through</li>
<li>Vent rat squad split up with Morgana checking the exit, Simon checking the rooms near the barracks and me checking the vents past the console room</li>
<li>Tracker chimes in that they can’t hold the line forever; we have to find ways to disturb the camera system without directly tripping anything so the Hemlocks think all the intruders are in the basement and not on our floor</li>
<li>I need to get into that console room for my data; Morgana seems to also want to locate von Spatz…</li>
<li>Simon gets data from another computer to get the rest of the floor layout (there’s an armory, elevators, officer’s quarters, prison barracks… Creel might be in those)</li>
<li>Damien and I are in the vent at the console; I see a broadcast from Milakai to the Hemlock’s on their TVs that they suspect we are not just in the basement but in the building</li>
<li>Simon lights the server room on fire as a distraction and all the entrances at the bridge close</li>
<li>We plan to have Damien burst through the vent to distract the guards gun blazing while Morgana takes out the camera and I hack the console</li>
<li>They see me as I try to sneak past (failed roll) and they shoot at me, I take 20 damage; Simon our medic heals me +6 and I rush to the console; Morgana uses the chaingun on the guard that shot me cause you don’t fuck with the Watchers (she got a 14 and a 16 fucking hell you do NOT fuck with the Watchers)</li>
<li>I get shot and take 14 damage; Simon heals me and I’m at 8 health</li>
<li>I am able to get in (14) but the data system is deleting itself so I get 5 questions</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>We ask where Creel is; southern part of the third floor</li>
<li>I ask for info on Spatz; he’s a Hemlock leader, operating at the Sauron tower</li>
<li>What are the sources of the temp disturbances in the basement; it pulls up basement feed or a giant bug monster devouring Knights</li>
<li>Who within the Watchtower is operating with Hemlock; I get an option of rolling a 1d4 meaning its possible there’s 4; a message from Malakai to Spy #4, a recent assignment to the Watchers</li>
<li>We find another traitor; someone who is running for Councilor, and a message is coming in from Paradox to Spy #2 and saying “I’m sure you’ll be a huge hit” and its a transmission from recent (from the last week, dating back to last Friday session, Sunday session, Wednesday session, or today)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>As we process this information, a Russian robot enters the room from the only exit and comes towards us…</li>
<li>Tracker comes through on our radio; he’s cutting out and we have to retreat soon; Simon detonates the bombs he left in the camera room</li>
<li>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t fuck with the Watchers&rdquo; - @Morgana Ilkay</li>
<li>”A robot version of Joseph Stalin runs towards you” - Sam</li>
<li>I learn that the Sauron tower has my data; I’m able to convince them that I and Morgana go to the tower to distract and prematurely disable the air defenses while the Knights save Creel</li>
<li>Damien busts open the doors with his grenades and we meet with the others on our mission; he then got a Nat 1 and tripped over himself mid run</li>
<li>The Knights burst through a room and find no one, though Simon saw on the map a secret room that might have Creel; they storm through with Simon’s hacking but they’re getting pursued and shot at; Tracker is downed next to Damien who goes berserk and starts blasting a giant beam of light at the pursuing Hemlock</li>
<li>Simon books it for Creel and sees him hunched; his face is hidden and his helmet is off, which he never shows anyone, not even Damien; he softly coughs out that the floors are electrified so Simon will need to find a way around that</li>
<li>Damien is blocking the bullets coming towards them even though the guards were already missing; he slides and fires another beam, getting insane stats and vaporizing them (the security cam caught this so others Hemlock are coming for them including the Russian robot)</li>
<li>Simon heals Tracker and then is able to leap around to get Creel, who he gets an arm around and pulls out of the cell</li>
<li>Squad Damien heads up top to the roof with Creel in tow, but he sees that the top floor hangar is opening up and a giant ant head ascends…</li>
<li>Anu had to leave so Damien is NPC now</li>
<li>Down in the basement, Ace goes up the elevator with the other Hemlock agents (still pretending to be them) and they tell him there’s a special order from Malakai to attack people in blue first (Watchers); he then turns into a gun and drops into the hand of the guy and as a gun and summons a dinosaurs which mauls the guy; Ace comms to me frantically to come get him and not worry about the dinosaurs</li>
<li>Smoke fuels the room but I’m able to rawdog a 1d12 to a 10 and tp me and Morgana out (because of how this place messes with temp we are a bit off the ground and take -2 health)(-2 charges for tp)</li>
<li>Ace controlling his dinosaur uses it to ram into the giant ant creature attacking him (there was one in the basement that crawled up I think)</li>
<li>Morgana steers clear of the ant, and targets the 4 baddies; she keeps them off me and wounds one; Jeremy the giant ant spits at the triceratops cause that’s a thing he does apparently</li>
<li>I grab Ace (I say I didn’t think I’d miss seeing him; he notes that I’m injured), move out of the way of the goons so Morgana can chain gun them without hitting me, and hits Jeremy with an Ace shot; its not down though, and aims spit at me</li>
<li>Ace controls his tric to trample a goon but they dive; Morgana kills a goon</li>
<li>Jeremy looks around and spits at everyone in range; I get a Nat fucking 12 + 4 and Morgana gets a 14 on rolling out of the way so we’re unharmed</li>
<li>The tric gets killed from a goon; i get shot and am downed; Jeremy looms over me and casts a leg down to spear me, before a metallic arm shoots out and stops it; a swarm of Chrono-Co robots almost identical to Ace swarms and joins the fray</li>
<li>Morgana slides over, takes and uncomfortable Ace and shoots him to finish off and evaporate Jeremy</li>
<li>more goons crawl but the Chrono-Co bots hold them off</li>
<li>Morgana stabilizes me and I get +health</li>
<li>I can’t sense anyone (von Spatz is not here); i try to teleport us and have to use the rest of my tp charges to get us up</li>
<li>We arrive and I see that the computers are smashed, like someone doesn’t want the info being found… I am able to collect 11% data at the expense of not being able to turn off the air defense, a choice Enigma doesn’t feel good about</li>
<li>There are 4 air guns and we use explosives to try and hit one primed to explode; Simon is able to get one down</li>
<li>Damien and robo-Stalin are dueling it out Duel of Fates style on the rooftops</li>
<li>I get a +1 to my AC (9 now)</li>
<li>Morgana had to get a Nat 12 to succeed in a thing AND SHE FUCKING DID and used Ace to take out one of the anti-aircraft gun; Enigma gives her a fond grin and a “welcome to the club”</li>
<li>Our evac arrives but we have to take out the last gun; the helicopter holding the other Knights and Creel gets hit and it starts faltering</li>
<li>I use a TU to tp me and Morgana (she’s holding Ace) out of there but we fall cause of the temp disturbance on my tp and I get downed again; Ace fails to help me and hits me with a wrench and I’m at three death saves; Morgana blessedly stabilizes me</li>
<li>Morgana drags me out of there and we cut towards the pipes; Chrono-Co bots and Knights and Hemlock are fighting; we use -1 TU to get back to HQ; we don’t see any sign of Clinton but Rachel Anderson of Chrono-Co (Ace not-so-quietly tells me who she is even though I know); she tells us to meet with McEntire and shakes our hands (and tries to plug in a pitch for automatons); she also hands me a 12% coupon</li>
<li>Jandro got back and had to decide to either protect Creel on impact and let Tracker and others die, or stabilize the ornithopter and save everyone; he makes a Crit success and gets the helicopter working, Tracker gets knocked out lmao but everyone’s alive; the missions was a success</li>
<li>They arrive and we are relieved; we talk to McEntire and he talks about psychic weaponry they thought only Second Hand used; unfortunately the Knights owe Chrono-Co; there’s grumblings about Knight leadership so that will be an issue, one that Chrono-Co might be taking advantage of</li>
<li>The Drunken Duckling is offering free drinks (I agree after a bit of prodding and promise of Shirley Temples)</li>
<li>We succeeded in getting Creel, but failed in retrieving other hostages; I succeeded on my personal mission, and we failed to get robo-Stalin or Malakai</li>
<li>Morgana suspects the traitor running for Council is Mr. Time and I chime in that the Clown is an ally of them; the “today” from the message could’ve been the Wednesday mission, as today the Knights running were with us (unless they’re hiding something)</li>
<li>Vivien suspects the numbering of the spies is for faction; Sam gives me some private info that the spy running is someone who wants to “look good” (Damien? Tho its nothing new for him; Ace, or Mr. Time; these are his three that he tells me in character are suspicious [Clown is also sus but that’s nothing new])</li>
<li>We discuss voting strategy (high charisma players have more voting power apparently)</li>
<li>The bar is being sponsored by the Clown</li>
<li>I question Ace’s ability to summon dinosaurs and Ace says he came across the Jurassic period and put items around that bring these dinos directly from there to the present; he assures us that “some watchers” gave him the ok to do so and as I prod him he says he’s not at liberty (he also alludes to that he can’t disclose if its a Councilor or not)</li>
<li>Morgana asks how Tuhorn got him to do this as he’s apparently been part of something like this; Ace’s eyes turn orange and answers it wasn’t Tuhorn and Morgana was successfully able to trick him into revealing that; she asks if it was the Lone Master and Ace’s eyes turn red as he says “perhaps it wasn’t a Watcher…”</li>
<li>In a private session, Morgana and I have some alone time and through some emotional prodding, I reveal that I believe Brad is a spy (I am clearly distraught)</li>
<li>She makes sure I can do what needs to be done if Brad is indeed a spy, but encourages that we will figure it out together, and she won’t tell a soul</li>
<li>After we have our heart to heart (Enigma’s first time trusting someone with emotional conflictions, or “opening up”), Enigma gets drunk and Morgana gets sugar high. The two stumble off into the night, with Morgana wanting to go to a bouncy castle, and Enigma drunkenly convincing herself said bouncy castle is a Hemlock base that must be investigated immediately</li>
<li>The next morning, Morgana and Enigma wake up in a bounce castle; the hangover is the only clue as to the mystery behind how they arrived there</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="elections">ELECTIONS</h1>
<ul>
<li>Mr. Time calls Chrono-Co a “corporate family” I wanna vomit</li>
<li>The Knights predictably get attacked for their failed and messy missions; Minutemen get attacked for being an unofficial faction that’s not likely to provide anything concrete; Chrono-co are capitalists; Watchers I think don’t have a strong presence</li>
<li>Ace tries to do a backflip and eats shit</li>
<li>Jett might be fucking dead cause his player is not Ross Perot who was an NPC and also “Jett” is no longer on the player list omfg</li>
<li>We reach a halftime and Breacher seems stressed; Damien has a team of Paladins doing his makeup and prepping him for the cameras</li>
<li>I listen to Perot and Clown’s conversation and learn that Perot is a Minuteman</li>
<li>During the halftime I am able to put a tracker on Clown, unsure if I was stealthy enough to purely get away with it tho</li>
<li>Ace and Damien greet me, with Damien giving me a big hug (I am stiff but give it a few seconds before pushing him off); I tell him he should worry more about his substance and he pulls out a bag of weed that I aggressively shove back into his pocket cause why tf would he whip that out during an election; Clown sees me shoving my hand in his pocket and thinks I’m fucking all the Knights (she still thinks I have a thing with Ace, and Ace really wants me to have a thing with Damien)</li>
<li>I don’t want the Knights to win, but I have a bond with them and am trying to keep them from sabotaging their own election (Ace asked me if he should turn into a gun and I said fuck no don’t do that during an election when a Councilor literally got shot to death)</li>
<li>Debate is back and I learn that Damien is a temporal refugee after a 1400s French incident, and he’s oddly sober when discussing refugees</li>
<li>(oh also Jett ain’t dead Aryan is just dual wielding characters)</li>
<li>Mr. Time talks about how refugees need jobs so Chrono-Co would love to employ them; Breacher swoops in that its the Minutemen who have been employing refugees more than anything</li>
<li>i learn that there’s a controversy surrounding Councilor Tuhorn; Marlow says even the Council should be held accountable</li>
<li>Mr. Time proclaims that he has evidence one of the people in this campaign may be a terrorist; he plays video footage of Damien sneaking into a database surrounded by lava, followed by him fighting robo-Stalin; its our mission, and the video makes it look almost staged (this was not allowed to be shown but Mr. Time shows it anyway)</li>
<li>Damien lets slip that we have Mr. Time as a suspect, I signal to him to keep his cool; he firmly defends himself and throws the blame on Chrono-Co</li>
<li>Ace throws Damien under the bus as being potentially a traitor lmao</li>
<li>The Clown takes off her head and reveals she’s actually an android being controlled by von Spatz (I shout WHAT from the audience); a screen shows that the real Clown is hostage and tied up in Stonehenge; von Spatz says “Breacher, I can’t believe you fell for it” before the screen goes dark</li>
<li>Perot gets blown up as the stage is alight (he’s dead rip)</li>
<li>Damien gets dragged off by Knights (Anu had to go) as a giant green dragon swoops into the stage; boss fight ensues</li>
<li>Tracker comes in cause its Sam’s favorite gag and pulls Barney to safety</li>
<li>The dragon breathes acid breath and kills Ross Perot</li>
<li>The cameras are still rolling; I rush over to the stage and shout “ACE, GUN” holding my arms out, he transforms and jumps into my arms (he specifically jumps into my arms before turning into a gun); I shoot for the eyes and can’t quite get it but I do cause injury</li>
<li>Breacher conjures a hologram dragon and it fools the real dragon to get its attention away</li>
<li>Mr. Time makes sure the cameras are on him, says a quip, and he fires a beam that misses</li>
<li>I take another shot at the eyes/head and pack a lot of damage; Ace in gun form asks me to throw him in its mouth when he signals and in the meantime he fires a laser that summons a pterodactyl</li>
<li>Breacher conjures a holographic walls between the fight and the audience so protect them (also conveniently covers the camera but the cameraman is some TMZ motherfucker who runs up to catch the footage)</li>
<li>Mr. Time once again looks into the camera, says “time’s up for terrorism”, and misses his shot</li>
<li>The dragon aims for me with a breath of flame and swipes a claw at me, downing me</li>
<li>Tracker successfully shoots the dragon; Ace looks down at me and says “this again?” (fuck you Ace); he makes his dino swarm the dragon’s face to distract it</li>
<li>Mr. Time once again looks into the camera, says “your time for terror is over”, and shoots it finally</li>
<li>The dragon changed colors from green to red, and now it breathes fire instead of acid breath</li>
<li>Tracker grabs Ace and shoots at the dragon; Jandro joined during the fight and heals me up +5 so I’m up</li>
<li>Mr. Time makes sure the camera is on him as he brings up some injured crowd members</li>
<li>The dino gets incinerated; I use my temporal gun on the dragon which deals a lot of damage</li>
<li>Tracker snaps and screams “SHOWTIME MOTHERFUCKERS” before unleashing bullets on the dragon, killing it</li>
<li>The cameraman pans over from Mr. Time in time to get me and Tracker’s combo-kill, which will produce interesting results… and that’s the end of the debates!</li>
<li>I learn that my punch on the Clown downed her half health out of session
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="session-5-chrono-co-mines">Session 5: Chrono-Co Mines</h1>
<ul>
<li>I am with the Sunday group, and am able to work with Morgana and Miri again while meeting the Magpie, Rosemary (Nila), and Sidney Stockton (Soup); Dr. Rain weren’t at session [they have a private chat I’m not part of so I don’t have all the details]</li>
<li>I learn that this group did lots of investigations in Tasha’s basement; they found tech that allows for you to do time jumps; Tasha was working with SecondHand, and the reports this group sent were picked up by a chimpanzee with a veil, and the group pursued the chimp; a chimp potentially works for Tuhorn; the group also talked to Florence, and Rosemary got out of them that they were confused (he kept speaking in Spanish); Morgana cold cased and saw that he had been revived; they recovered various things from the basement including a clay doll pulled out of time</li>
<li>Our leads; 1. missing Selene, who left through Tasha’s basement; 2. The chimp, though we need to track them; 3. The five words Florence told them</li>
<li>We go to the basement, where a vault lays that has yet to be cracked; pawn to E4 is on the door?; Miri browses around and sees a large list saying “21 Days”, and it mentions “The End?”, “Timeout?”, and a couple notes that are color coded saying:
“What do they want”
Chrono: Holly TL -&gt; Power
Knight: End of HEMLOCK
Watcher: Our fail -&gt; End of us
SH: Stop the end
HEMLOCK: Fight the Fight
TIMEOUT: The End of Everything</li>
<li>This investigation occurred</li>
<li>Miri sees a blue note saying “hire Selene”; it looks like a personal note of rec for her being a Watcher</li>
<li>”Timeout” is a sketchy org we know nothing about that Morgana knows about from prior investigations</li>
<li>Miri has a kaleidoscope ability… she sees the clay doll and chess board is out of place; the desk has dust that’s out of place; someone has been traveling in and out of here; dusty fingerprints that have temp aura are present, on a note about Pompeii, a blueprint for a submarine, and an article about “mining on the moon” with Holly Holland quoting about time fluid reserves with “new reserve” underlined</li>
<li>Miri regards she’s seen talk of Pompeii before; this group has info that the object Selene took from Tasha after shooting her was a kaleidoscope</li>
<li>As they’re investigating, the group hears an explosion outside and some talk of a dragon; sometime shortly, I arrive</li>
<li>Miri greets me and is off put by seeing me hungover and post-dragon fight; Morgana advocates for me and Miri is surprised by how familiar we seem cause she doesn’t trust me; Miri doesn’t remember me so she’s very off-put that I know who she and Selene are</li>
<li>I can’t hack the computer, its an older model that isn’t fully compatible with my hacking skills (Miri makes me try “password” as a password)</li>
<li>Miri uses her kaleidoscope to see some of the keyboard keys were pressed like so (its the number of times each letter appears in the password):
a = 2e = 2i = 1k = 1m = 1n = 1u = 1s = 1t = 2</li>
<li>Rosemary calls up an art history expert (Lily) to go over the clay doll; it was taken out of time and is European made, Italy or France; its a toy or statue but its not refined, a common object that wasn’t used by elites; it could be from Pompeii as it was before 5th Century AD, and it looks Roman (though that’s a big empire that covers lots of ground); its seems to be a decorative or toy that’s part of a set, so there may be another out there, they wouldn’t be exactly the same but relatively so</li>
<li>Magpie finds the password is “TAKES A MINUTES” and the computer opens up; we see tons of files about this moon mining; also an entry on time wikipedia about “the last resort”, its restricted access and seems to depict a location near a lake; Jane Doe and Larry Morton’s files have been opened up (they’re the competent old school Watchers, and the notes says Jane has a temper when people mess with the timeline; they both have hidden and redacted details as this is Counsilor info; the two were working on something it seems); there’s a chat log with most messages having been deleted but saying “wait for me… found something… talking to detective shortly”;6:10 on the day Tasha died, 30 mins prior to her death</li>
<li>Jane is Morgana’s Counsilor; Larry was apparently in charge of overseeing an apprehended SecondHand (probably Florence who was in Watcher custody)</li>
<li>Morgana takes a harddrive of the info and has a theory that as this place, Tasha’s basement, is in the direction of the Minutemen markets, Selene has a connection to here (especially since this place was bequeathed to Selene); the will was made a day or two after Tasha’s death, and the provisions of this house’s lease was apparently edited</li>
<li>I find docs on moon mining locations, and realize the resources being received from them doesn’t add up with how small the area is and how short the expeditions were (reportedly the resources were being mined at higher numbers should be possible); Tasha and perhaps Selene were onto this</li>
<li>I deduce that minings happened in this same area but at various time periods to produce as much as was gotten</li>
<li>I learn that Holly was talking about minings and she oversaw the moon mining, and a desert mining operation happened separate from this; Morgana says they saw a video about alternate time/different time period earth</li>
<li>There’s chatter of a Lake Tahoe and a Last Resort from this group from missions I wasn’t there for</li>
<li>Watchers have Archive access; Morgana and Sidney find files on the Last Resort while I tell them leads from the computer; the Last Resort (and Spa) has a barebones article about it being in Lake Tahoe in [didn’t catch the coord or time period]</li>
<li>By chance, I happen to have coordinates that match Tahoe… my lead from Florence. I tell the group (Morgana) and we head off</li>
<li>Rosemary finds that the doll is from Pompeii; 200BC-300AD Naples, Italy is the time range</li>
<li>Magpie says Tuhorn checks in on her research occasionally; he’s into animals and wants to research the chronosaur (time dinosaur)</li>
<li>Tuhorn’s younger brother is also a thing (Longhorn?)</li>
<li>Leads: 1. Pompeii, sometime and something 2. Holly Holland moon mines 3. Last Resort and Spa in Lake Tahoe</li>
<li>The group wants to go to the mines but Chrono-Co is in charge; Chrono-Co doesn’t want us Watchers poking around and Rosemary’s trying hard to get us access, she’s able to get us access</li>
<li>Magpie drives us through the moon area until we get to the sight, and before we meet up with the Chrono-Co people I slink off with a couple others to not be seen by Holly (its just Rosemary and Sidney talking to them)</li>
<li>Holly is there, tired, along with a man named Ross; he mentions they use “mark effects”? As a biodegradable eco friendly material (he’s bullshitting and using business buzz words he’s fucking Chrono-Co); Rose sold the pitch that Sidney’s here for eco-observation</li>
<li>Ross mentions a certain area off limits as its undergoing operations (he sideyes Holly)</li>
<li>Sidney prods about the environmental impact, and Ross states that they disrupt the environment as little as possible thanks to friends at the refinery department; Sidney can tell he’s not entirely lying, there isn’t really environmental impact, but the idea that its because of the “refinery process” is sus and something’s off; something secret is going on regarding the high resource turnout and how exactly they’re able to maintain the environment</li>
<li>Time fluid is made of chronite as a main material (with some lithium and nickel); its in everything, watches, household items, even Watchtower infrastructure; I have a theory that the methods used to bypass WatchTower security has to do with bypassing chronite</li>
<li>Sidney and Magpie give us buffs so we’re increased stealth and can talk without being heard</li>
<li>Magpie scouts while Morgana, Miri and me go through the mines</li>
<li>My Time Sense picks up that there are people all over the mines, workers from the looks; there’s a shaft that looks quieter for entry</li>
<li>Miri’s kaleidoscope shows similar readings, as well as a blotch following us the size of a baseball; its invisible when not looking through the kaleidoscope, and only shows on it; I can’t sense it as I sense temporal anomalies and off energy while Miri’s item detects any and all energy; Miri goes to poke it and Morgana and I simultaneously shoot out hands out to stop her lmao</li>
<li>Its flying in a straight line; Morgana wants to shoot it lmao, and its escaping so she shoots; it hits and falls, turning visible and revealing to be a drone; Magpie retrieves the remains</li>
<li>Most of the mining ops are underground, a mining elevator is present, we have to go through tunnels or shafts while Magpie goes invis through the main gate past the guards</li>
<li>Magpie sees into the refinery where purple material is being produced, it seems normal from the vantage point; there’s an operative that might have more info; they can tell there’s not any exceptional excess of material like what the reports show, its standard production for the area</li>
<li>Magpie goes into an empty office but doesn’t find much (failed roll; password locked comp and Chrono-Co lingo they can’t understand); I suggest Magpie scans the papers for Rosemary to read and I could maybe hack the computer</li>
<li>We go through a shaft that leads to power drills and such; an elevator is to our right, left is the way we came</li>
<li>We go to the elevator and a couple of people are coming up (Chrono-Co armored guards stand close to the elevator entrance, we hear them talking about extra employees at sub level who they haven’t seen around; also Holly’s stopping by and they seem to not like Ross)</li>
<li>There are miners near lockers, nothing special; we go to sublevel; me and Morgana are stealthy in going through the elevator, but Miri stumbles; before she’s seen, I grab Miri and Morgana and tp us inside the elevator (-3 charges; also im APPARENTLY ON 1 HP)</li>
<li>I quip “might want to work on that stealth” to miri (she’s the watcher baby lmao)</li>
<li>We see 10 normal access areas and an 11th restricted area; we’re at Level 7 and find a hatch to go through, however our elevator starts going upwards again; Morgana expertly lock picks the elevator so it stops and goes back down (14 baby)</li>
<li>We are in an office space, like a doctor’s office lobby (exec offices); what we notice is a man sitting at a desk and reaches for something as he realizes we don’t belong here (we all got god rolls but for fucking initiative)</li>
<li>Morgana uses her energy taser from Zephyr and hits him, though he’s still awake; I hurl my energy baton at him and successfully knock him down for Morgana to tase before he can push the button</li>
<li>We see places for doctor’s office, Labs, Experimental refinery, and “Timeline”</li>
<li>All my HP is restored cause Sam forgot to tell me lmao</li>
<li>We sneak through (I made some noise but Sidney’s buff mutes it)</li>
<li>We see someone who looks like the Pope who enters a restricted area after guards see his ID; this is the Timeline; there’s bronze discs lining the walls like in another time jumping room this group has seen; we decide to backtrack and see the other places first in case this area leads to us having to book it</li>
<li>Me and Miri sense/see the Timeline is definitely using the same plates as in the basement; things are being transported between different times and timelines; we hear a guard call for a recall of one of the things, they pull a lever and someone in a cardinal uniform comes back, changes to a suit and tie, and goes through again (they’re sending people on missions throughout time like what we do); they’re unregulated sending people to and from timelines to interfere with alternate timelines</li>
<li>Magpie meets with us, and we go to the Lab; people are testing time tech, and Zephyr-like items are being used; there’s time capsules (for item transmission), which Knights are big on using; the lab is crawling with people</li>
<li>The elevator open up and Holly Holland comes through, calling for a Wilbur (the guy we knocked out); we decide this is too risky and retreat</li>
<li>we go to the Experimental Refinery and see doors that periodically open by 30 second intervals; a purple hue shows something being placed in objects; its minerals that are definitely being transported from other timelines to here</li>
<li>Someone sees Morgana and red lights blare as Holly pushed the button; we’re out of time and need to plan fast</li>
<li>Magpie runs into the Timeline room to take pictures for us before running out, and I will use my tp to get us out</li>
<li>Each TU can be redeemed for 2 charges; 5 TU = 10 charges</li>
<li>Me and Morgana want to get more info, and my fingers twitch as I almost blip into the Timeline room to get the pictures… but I turn and look at Miri, who’s just a kid, and Morgana, who I can’t risk getting hurt, and frustratedly give up to tp us all out</li>
<li>I tp us to where Rosemary and Sidney are (-12 charges) and we rush out</li>
<li>I stumble and am seen by guards, and get shot so I’m downed in ONE FUCKING TURN AGAIN WHERE I CAN’T FUCKING DO ANYTHING I SWEAR TO GOD JUST LET ME TP OUT</li>
<li>Magpie takes Miri and runs, while Morgana rushes back to me but Rosemary steps in and convinced the guards not to kill me (for questioning, its her way of getting me out of this), and she’s able to get them to just take me</li>
<li>Morgana is incredibly distraught, but she can’t do anything to break me out (not now at least); they’ll pull all the strings they have, but I am dragged off… Rosemary and Sidney are not compromised so they’re escorted out</li>
<li>I am put in handcuffs that prevent my tp</li>
<li>Chrono-Co tells Rosemary to keep an eye on Morgana, she’s suspicious now in the eyes of CC; she also does a sort of hand shaking trick where she’s looking for someone with soft hands; she got crucial info that Lord Commander McEntire has rough and calloused hands, while High Cleric Thorwald doesn’t match the hands she’s looking for; Tracker doesn’t have soft hands either; Paladin Glass, Cleric Orlaith, Cleric Hathmar, and Damien are her suspects</li>
<li>Zephyr’s work doesn’t seem to have anything to do with this, Mr. Time and Will Dalton have good reps</li>
<li>The drone is analyzed to be from the Minuteman district; Magpie doesn’t recognize it</li>
<li>The team discusses what to do next… and Morgana intends to do whatever necessary to get me out
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="breakout-wed">Breakout (Wed)</h1>
<p>Group One, Enigma rescue squad: Ace, Morgana, Magpie, Rosemary
Group Two, Clown rescue squad: Simon, Jett, Breacher, Clown, Mr. Time</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasn’t here for the full session, I joined at the point where they’re breaking me out (by design, but it means I have canonical catch up)</li>
<li>I apparently learned quite a lot by working in these alternate timeline mines… also, I’ve been gone for 100 days (because of how time works, for everyone else its been a week)</li>
<li>I am visibly more toned (I asked Sam lmao); I also have nothing on me accept some chronite that I nabbed</li>
<li>I am told to sign an NDA by Holly Holland to not discuss anything I’ve seen here and I am free per negotiations by Rosemary</li>
<li>I am stoned face and refuse to sign it; I notice some invisibility near by… (its Ace)</li>
<li>Ace signals to me, and despite my hatred of this situation, I sign it; Rosemary and Morgana come in with security guards (they have to give up weapons)</li>
<li>William Dalton and Holly Holland are also with goons; I am brought out (still restrained) to Morgana and Rosemary; Morgana mouths “sorry” but I don’t move</li>
<li>Rosemary is questioned and discusses the strange amount of output Chrono-Co is getting from these mines; the “two Watchers that were involved” signed the NDA (me and Morgana presumably, they haven’t caught Miri or Sidney) which Rose uses to try and get us out of this</li>
<li>Dalton and Holland argue over not being transparent with each other; tensions in Chrono-Co are a tad high, not everyone knew about this moon mining; Cecilia, Dalton’s wife, will start overseeing the mining operation over Holland</li>
<li>Holly says “she’ll miss me” working in the mines; I want her head</li>
<li>The Watchers are now in hot water with Chrono-Co; Holly wants to be able to continue running her operations despite Dalton wanting to impose more transparency, regardless Holly has agreed to more regulation (she’s been embezzling from Chrono-Co)</li>
<li>I realize that this group (Rosemary in particular) have a greater plan that they’re trying to keep from falling apart</li>
<li>Holly is in charge of the alt timelines, Dalton is in charge of the production from this timelines</li>
<li>Rosemary does a roll that hits the DC exactly and clutches this whole deal that will ensure Cecilia will oversee some of this production with Holly’s full cooperation</li>
<li>As they are about to sign this deal, Holly gets a message in her earpiece and she suddenly calls for all the doors to lock down and for the facility to be shut; Holly says its not me, but “them”; guns are being pointed at me and Morgana; they say a Watcher is being detected invisible in the building with a gun (its Magpie who is invisible with Ace that they’re mistaking as a Watcher)</li>
<li>Morgana is unable to convince them she’s completely uninvolved; they restrain her, though Dalton looks very confused; Magpie and Ace are on the other side of the door</li>
<li>Me, Morgana and Rosemary are brought into a private call; I tell them trying to execute Watchers they were about to release; Dalton doesn’t want to harm us and is trying to get Holly to lower her gun</li>
<li>Rosemary is being questioned hard and I tell them (out of character) to talk about the drone we shot down in the first mission, that whoever owned that drone is probably who the hidden person is (it worked, Rose did a 17 for convincing! Though i learn later that apparently the drone belonged to Breacher, who Rosemary has accidentally thrown under the bus)</li>
<li>Breacher signed a different NDA that apparently she broke (Alek Wilde knew); Breacher is now being pressured by Chrono-Co to sign an NDA</li>
<li>Rosemary convinced them that Breacher is reliable</li>
<li>Holland wants 10 minutes with me alone; Dalton is very confused by why she wants this, and Rosemary tries to ensure that Holland won’t harm me on account that Breacher hasn’t signed the NDA and may let spill if she finds out anything happened to me</li>
<li>Holland is hard pressed to have these 10 minutes, and I’m ensured to not be memory wiped; we are waiting for Breacher to sign the NDA before we leave, and Morgana is given permission to watch us talk from afar to ensure they’re not mind wiping me</li>
<li>In a minute, our friends will arrive to pick us up; we are not to discuss anything about these talks; Rosemary is released (she also has a new job opening)(Nila had to leave cause it was so late for her she saw the damn sun rise)</li>
<li>Cecilia Dalton is the PR person for Chrono-Co</li>
<li>Ace says Chrono-Co are looking around for a drone now (good for Magpie to be undetected)</li>
<li>I just now learn that Watchers are blue, Minutemen are green, Chrono-Co are yellow, and Knights are red (SecondHand are orange and Hemlock are purple)</li>
<li>Apparently Breacher couldn’t sign the NDA cause she’s fighting zombies to break the Clown out of Hemlock or some shit</li>
<li>Ace became friends with the Ace squad while I was gone</li>
<li>Rosemary was called into another call to do Chrono-Co stuff</li>
<li>Breacher (hologram) walks into the room; tensions have cooled after an hour or so (2 automatons, 2 goons, Holland, Dalton and the rest of us players are in the room); she agrees to sign the NDA since Breacher is a friend of mine (aw ;-;)</li>
<li>If the info gets out and its found to have come from someone connected to any of the NDA signers, our group from this mission or our Councilors, I’m fucked (if it got out in <em>other</em> ways… that’s a different story)</li>
<li>Holland pulls me aside for the 10 minute convo; I’m brought to an elevator that brings us down to the doctor’s office we saw before; I am strapped down and a doctor flips a syringe and I am informed I will have an explosive implanted in me, if I break the NDA or attempt to remove it it will explode; I glare daggers at Holly</li>
<li>Holly suspects more than just Breacher was involved (she’s suspicious of Sidney, and she says Rachel Anderson believes it was an invisible Watcher who was present)</li>
<li>I learn that Chrono-Co voted to have me killed or in the mines</li>
<li>The chip is put in me, and I am let go</li>
<li>We meet up at the Lucky Ducks (the bartender nods at Breacher, this is a Minuteman bar), and Breacher tells us someone already leaks the info about Holly Holland to the press, and it has to be someone in our group; Morgana suspects its Rachel Anderson, who is in charge of automaton who knew something about our invisible person (she thinks it might be Ace)</li>
<li>Anyone could’ve leaked it, including Sidney, one of us (Breacher, Ace, Simon, Magpie, Morgana, Miri, Rosemary); Sidney might have leaked before she knew it was something we weren’t supposed to do; Breacher knew it was leaked and told us so probably wasn’t her; Simon was’t here for this; Miri doesn’t know shit so it wasn’t her; Rose is unlikely since she doesn’t want Chrono-Co shit being leaked; Magpie and Ace are most likely from this group but we just don’t know, Ace says at one point him and Magpie threatened to leak if they didn’t get money but Ace didn’t actually do anything</li>
<li>I walk outside the building for a few minutes… to punch a tree</li>
<li>Tracker walks in cause he needed a drink and leaves cause he wasn’t allowed in lmao; he sees me punching a tree so hard my hands get bloody; he can’t see my face but I’m shaking; he goes into a story about ice cream and offers to take me to get some in an attempt to cheer me up; I cut him off, ask when the Knights mission is, and tell him to prepare before walking off who knows where… he cleans up the trail of blood I leave</li>
<li>Breacher knows Magpie is a deep agent of Alek Wilde, so Breacher doesn’t suspect her; she suspects Ace, who defends himself with he has no motive to leak any of this (also he’s my friend)</li>
<li>In my spare time, Enigma’s gonna make notes and work on her missions; she arrives at her place in the Knights barracks, where a cool energy gun and a box of ice cream lies (Tracker’s gift ;-;)</li>
<li>”Tracker is the only human besides Enigma who this cold heartless robot cares about” - Ace</li>
<li>Ace says he trusts me as I’m a “kindred soul” and I was the first to use him as a gun; I was a good shot</li>
<li>I contact Larry Mortz, and he says he trusts me; he paired me with the Knights cause he needed me, on the inside; he tells me a secret, Hemlock doesn’t care about goals, they just want the fighting to continue, which is perfect for the Knights who love fighting but a nightmare for the Watchers; which is why we needed Watchers to oversee the Knights; he has a goal with Jane Doe to have Watchers overseeing more so peace can thrive; I tell him thank you for working with me</li>
<li>I realize mine and Morgana’s Councilors are working together, just like we are</li>
<li>I create contingencies, notes for people in case I go… I compile all my notes I’ve ever taken for Larry Mortz, as well as Morgana and Breacher (the stuff that’s relevant to them, I would mention me and Marlow but I wouldn’t go into details just cause its not relevant)</li>
<li>back at the bar, the group tries to contact the Clown who is recovering; they are convinced she will know; Breacher also knows where I am for some reason</li>
<li>Ace knows about the bomb in me; I agree to meet with him at an abandoned warehouse in the Abandoned Districts; his eyes light up green as he meets me and I learn he comes here to “recharge”; he learned from Morgana who Ace believes told no one else</li>
<li>I tell Ace my death wouldn’t matter, just focusing on the mission; he offers to kill me if I want to die quickly and painlessly with temporal handcuffs that would instantaneously delete me from all existence</li>
<li>Before I can make a decision, the whole squad busts down the door guns drawn; they relax, and take in my appearance (Watcher uniform pants, white tanktop, dried blood on me from previous missions and punching a tree, covered in soot from working in the mines, and more toned despite being gone a week)</li>
<li>Morgana puts a hand on Ace’s shoulder and spasms out for a sec (she tried to cold case him but he’s a robot so it went weirdly, I don’t know this though)</li>
<li>I get control of myself and question how they knew where me and Ace were; Morgana says “detective, deal with it”; she also private DM’d me earlier not to do anything reckless</li>
<li>Morgana finds that Ace was the one who leaked it and tells the group, also revealing “great job Ace, you killed Enigma”; Ace questions how she would know and she says its cause she saw him do it (Ace plugged into a computer as him and Magpie were leaving, thus leaking the info); Ace denies this, saying he was just plugging into shit cause he does that; Breacher believes Ace did it</li>
<li>As they argue, a knock comes; Ace says “come in” and Tracker pops in saying he knows he doesn’t want me being bothered but Lord Commander McEntire wants to see me</li>
<li>I tell everyone it doesn’t matter, we just need to take down Hemlock before this all goes down for me (Breacher and Morgana are not willing to let that happen)</li>
<li>i learn that Morgana cold cased Ace, and they are all infighting; I tell shout enough as Breacher says we need to go; suddenly, robots swarm in</li>
<li>The Magpie hears a female voice saying “focus your fire on Enigma!”; the 6 robots train their guns on me, they look like Ace units</li>
<li>As we start to fight, I learn that I got a bit of “hardiness” in the mines… +8 health, +3 hardiness</li>
<li>These units are resistant to physical damage; three robots fire at me and I take 28 damage (I am downed); there are 6 so far but they’re coming in waves and more may come in…</li>
<li>They’re coming in from the front entrance; the other exits are high windows</li>
<li>Morgana stabilizes me; I’m on 1hp and the robots do either physical or energy</li>
<li>with my TU and my regular charges I have 18 charges total; the robots in the back are focusing their guns on Ace</li>
<li>we go to a bar where they don’t ask too many questions and with three charged per person (-12) to get us closer to the place (Ace tps to the Watchtower on his own, we take Breacher’s drone so it doesn’t count as a person); Morgana isn’t able to make it so her with Breacher’s drone have to keep running (Breacher conjures a wall to give them visual cover); Magpie is invis so she slips inside</li>
<li>I tp me and Magpie to Morgana, Morgana gets shot at and Simon tanks some of it so she’s not downed, and I run out to tp me Morgana and Simon back while Magpie invis runs back</li>
<li>Ace sees a robot snap towards him and use some time bullshit; Rachel Anserson walks up to him and says “perhaps you need some reprogramming..” before they drag him off</li>
<li>I message him and he doesn’t answer…</li>
<li>Scotty the bartender covers for us as guards come looking for us, and we emerge after he gives an all clear</li>
<li>Simon punches me for being dumb and I go down before he revives me</li>
<li>Morgana says she saw Ace do some work for Rachel Anderson; she also accidentally lets it slip to everyone else (Simon and Magpie, she already snitched to Breacher) that i have a bomb</li>
<li>Morgana mentions a Dr. Rain, who has a time stop ability that could be used to remove the bomb; Breacher’s method is a 50/50 chance; also the Clown could possibly do it, I despise it but Breacher says she might be able to do so</li>
<li>I want to focus on Hemlock and Breacher and Morgana angrily tell me we need to get the chip out; I get one last message from Ace of Fry and the robot hugging before he is offline</li>
<li>I question why Holly would send robots to kill me when we had a deal and she can kill me with the chip; we realize it wasn’t Holly or Dalton but someone else from Chrono-Co</li>
<li>Breacher tells me and Morgana something privately; she can recruit the SecondHand (they fill me on what happened in the Bloodhounds mission, they found a resort on Lake Tahoe 30 years out of time in the future; 30 years in the future, all of the WatchTower are dead because of a war between the factions that wipes everyone out; young Tuhorn was there, and he and SecondHand are working to prevent it); the head of Hemlock is the only one who survives 30 years in the future, and Bloodhounds believe that person becomes Malakai von Spatz; I realize Hemlock might actually be the good guys</li>
<li>The Watchers want the end of the world to happen because its part of the timeline</li>
<li>I am in huge denial and shock myself with a baton to compose myself; I still wish to maintain the timeline despite some Watchers being against it (like Tuhorn), and she’s incredibly conflicted but decides to at least go to the Last Resort to see for herself</li>
<li>Breacher knows Rachel Anderson is militarizing automatons to make money; she also is fully convinced Ace is working with Rachel Anderson</li>
<li>I am very aggravated about Breacher and Morgana not wanting me to tell anyone (they can tell I’m hiding some intentions, but I am honest about not talking to anyone. Not yet anyway…)</li>
<li>I realize Larry Mortz might be aware of all of this, and now I don’t know who to trust</li>
<li>Breacher has an invisible drone following someone, she had one on Miri and Ace at some point and I realize her drone was what was following me and Ace, and she heard our convo about Ace offering to shoot me; I also see Breacher’s drone footage of Ace conspiring with Anderson and am told he shot a Councilor</li>
<li>Between Damien possibly being a spy, Brad most likely being a spy, SecondHand trying to prevent a time war while the Watchers (most likely her own Counsilor) is part of wanting to allow it,</li>
<li>Breacher’s SecondHand contact voice comes in to Breacher’s watch, and mentions we lost Tasha and Jake Roberts (Greece), McEntire is part of it, plus Tuhorn; Larry and Jane Doe are on the sus list for wanting to maintain the timeline even if it results in everything going to hell (there’s also a group or person known as the “The Eyes Unseen”)</li>
<li>the contact says we need to get Rachel Anderson exposed and arrested (NOT killed), and to prevent the Watchers from learning about this; Dalton might be our friend as well</li>
<li>Ace did something and Breacher and Morgana can’t tell me or some temporal affect will kill me; SecondHand know about it</li>
<li>Ace erased the Counsilor from existence and hearing this hurts my head (its part of the affect); apparently Ace’s cuffs that he was going to give me were used for something, and we need access to his memory bank so we actually need to rescue him; if we can get his info out we can maybe get the Watchers, Knights and some of Chrono-Co to be on our side</li>
<li>We’re not sure where exactly Hemlock lies in this, we know SecondHand is trying to prevent a time war; they may be taking advantage of the war for personal goals, we’re not sure</li>
<li>We need the Clown, SecondHand, a high profile Minuteman Breacher knows to get the chip out of me</li>
<li>Breacher also tells us they found Madame E and she’s in the same place as Breacher’s contact; they tell me this, I start laughing hysterically, and blip out…
OBJECTIVE: Remove tracker, talk to McEntire, talk to Larry Mortz, go to Yosemite 2301</li>

<p>Team: Morgana, Breacher, The Clown</p>
<ul>
<li>We regroup and work to recruit the Clown, as well as “The Grasshopper” and “Piglet”</li>
<li>To get coords to the WatchTower, you’d need them from High Paladin Cree, Jane Doe, or Will Dalton; we decide to go to the Last Resort for my procedure</li>
<li>Breacher calls up the Clown and explains the situation and to not tell anyone from Chrono-Co (Clown is very confused. Like extremely confused. All Breacher told her earlier was there a bomb in someone she needed Clown to get out)</li>
<li>Clown makes a head joke and I bury my head in my hands</li>
<li>My chance of survival is 56%; we are to meet at Tasha’s estate and head to the Last Resort</li>
<li>Breacher’s able to barter for getting bomb removal equipment and aid for 20 credits (+20 for transport)</li>
<li>I realize just now that I have a pocket watch and can store shit omfg; we use it to store the Grasshopper’s equipment over to Tasha’s estate, where we meet with the Clown</li>
<li>Breacher notices a press person watching us and taking pictures</li>
<li>NPC Miri is tired of people using her house but lets us into the basement</li>
<li>We head to the Last Resort a year after Breacher and Morgana’s last meeting; we travel through a secret jump point that flies under the radar</li>
<li>We had a note that said “21 days until the end” that was given 8 days ago; 13 days, just as I learned with Malakai</li>
<li>Coords are set, we use a TU (-1, but I was given an extra so I’m still at 5)</li>
<li>We appear on the shores of Lake Tahoe, though its not the one from the Bloodhounds previous mission; it is a desert that looks like it had been ravaged; it looks like a wasteland, no signs of life accept for a moon and lake that glow purple</li>
<li>We see on the lakeside a resort, the one standing building Lagoona Resort and Spa (the “Lagoona” is spray painted over “Last”)</li>
<li>Breacher and Clown banter, and we def have to give Clown answers</li>
<li>We go to the LR, its not in the best condition but someone lives here</li>
<li>Breacher rings a bell, and an automaton welcomes us; we ask for a Malcolm who we’re told is busy but rooms 301 and 302 have people waiting for us (we get a message from Malcolm who is a bit frazzled)</li>
<li>We also get a sudden message someone is waiting for us at 103, and the robot also says 666 and its eyes turn red (its a weird one)</li>
<li>Piglet says Quade (Frenchman), Riley (in a wheelchair), Spot (dog) and them are in 301 and 302 ready for us; (young) Tuhorn is in 103; I learn that Breacher was involved in Piglet getting their hand cut off and Riley doesn’t trust them as a result but whatever (they’re sisters)</li>
<li>Riley says that her and I have met, another me</li>
<li>Malaki is outside by a gravestone, talking to himself…</li>
<li>We are led downstairs to a lab, its a bit crude but it works; Piglet watched TimeTube videos to understand how it works (I’m doomed)</li>
<li>The Clown will be operating a machine that will pull out the bomb (she’s the bomb expert), Piglet will be cutting me open</li>
<li>The Clown learns about what happened at the debate lmao, and that Hemlock has a target on her</li>
<li>Clown and Riley know each other, she tried to shoot Clown back in Egypt and also accidentally killed a cat</li>
<li>NPC Rosemary is here lmao (real Rose approved)</li>
<li>I tell the Clown thanks, and I go to the table and am put under</li>
<li>The Clown fumbles her first roll, but is able to extract it; Morgana rushes forward as its about to explode and is able to grab it and throw it, though she isn’t able to get it out in time before… her hand gets blown off</li>
<li>Clown stabilizes her; Morgana is a little delirious and laughs hysterically at a “need a hand joke” from Quade</li>
<li>I awaken, and upon being told its out, take a shaky breath of relief</li>
<li>Morgana waves at me with her bloody stump and I rush over shakily to wrap it; Quade tourniquets it and Grasshopper offers to reattach her hand for us explaining the situation</li>
<li>The hand is attached but not perfectly (Morgana takes a -1 disadvantage on her agility rolls); I hold her hand and apologize, Morgana insists its not my fault and I can make it up to her with icecream</li>
<li>We retire to the living room to explain things and young Tuhorn is sitting there watching cartoons (Blorbo)</li>
<li>We’re 30 years in the future, and explain to Clown the situation; everyone dies accept Malcolm Spencer and the Clown because of a big war caused by the factions using bioweapons</li>
<li>The Clown doesn’t remember much from their time before becoming “The Clown”, and Breacher says she used to live here until an experimental cure for bio weapons that was used on her went wrong; Clown needs a moment to sit down</li>
<li>As far as Breacher knows, a few years ago is when the Clown from this timeline leaves and joins the Watchtower; we learn she is Malakai’s daughter (Izzy)</li>
<li>Clown flashbacks to when her father was telling her she would be ok as she’s convulsing, he was desperately trying to save her but next thing she remembers is waking up in a grave</li>
<li>I reveal that I knew she was supposed to be dead, but I am very confused as to how she’s alive</li>
<li>Blorbo suddenly appears as a corporeal being, and tells us to follow them; apparently they’re who kidnapped the Clown in Scotland</li>
<li>We recognize the automaton vaguely but its not Ace…</li>
<li>We follow Blorbo to 666; the room numbers are strange; Clown opens the door and we see weird clown stuff and funhouse mirrors; a record player plays circus music</li>
<li>In a swivel chair is a doctor who says he could’ve done the procedure better than anyone, and could even fix Morgana’s hand… for a deal. He says to look out the window and we see a second doctor (another of this guy) coming next to Malakai at the grave, sprinkling purple dust over the grave… this doctor did necromancy to bring her back for a deal from her father</li>
<li>The doc says the world ending is fun but so is it not ending; he’s not sure, but he knows we need help (his smile is like the IT clown); he says with a snap of his fingers he could disintegrate Morgana or bring the president of Spain in and turn him into a tank; snaps his fingers and Morgana feels some energy damage, but to flex and he gives us his number in case we need anything at all</li>
<li>The doc says “lets see what you think of me” and makes the room into a therapy office with Breacher on the couch (Breacher feels like her real body is there) and shows her footage of her real body rotting</li>
<li>I question why he brought the Clown back to life, and I learn her dad wanted his daughter back and wanted some one to mess with the Watcher separately, and the doc combined it</li>
<li>I ask how two doctors exist at once without paradoxing, and he says “well, we’re a pair o’ docs!”;&hellip; this is Paradox, our greatest enemy</li>
<li>Clown introduces us to Paradox as the Big Man/her friend (he turns into Blorbo and mocks that “I’m your friend Izzy!”); Clown says they’re friends as much as one could be as someone who is more like a toy for this primordial being (he turns Clown into a toy just to flex and turns her back; I am horrified)</li>
<li>Breacher doesn’t believe in gods, but she does believe in fucked up beings beyond us that can’t be trusted</li>
<li>Doc tells Clown not to miss “evil therapy on tuesday”&hellip; someone in this circle is Spy #1, most likely Clown</li>
<li>Doc says he’s tired of Breacher and Clown and shucks them out of the room, leaving just me and Morgana; Morgana asks what the price of a deal is (Doc throws out a quip that if we don’t call for his help Breacher might die)</li>
<li>He also says I might die soon cause I’m an anomaly like him and the Watchers will want me dead in the grand scheme; there’s also someone I know personally who is planning to kill me and one I know impersonally who wants me dead</li>
<li>We are shucked out of the room, which now reads 207; I am haunted</li>
<li>What Breacher feels for Blorbo is what I feel for Holly Holland</li>
<li>Piglet tells us Paradox works with Hemlock, and can do weird shit</li>
<li>Before Clown goes to talk to the Malakai below (who just revived her in this timeline) I give her the Yosemite coordinates</li>
<li>Clown talks to Malakai (the one who just revived her in the past) and is a bit drunk but is touching her face and looks happy she’s “all grown up”; Clown tears up a bit and says she’s ok; Malakai is concerned that that “thing” has a hold on her (Paradox); Malakai says last he saw her she was 7 or 8, but now she’s all grown up</li>
<li>Malakai says Paradox promised to revive Clown but if he got to take her away; Malakai reveals he’s working on a plan called “Hemlock”, and that when Paradox offers something, he can’t refuse the offer whatever it is (that gives us a leg up)</li>
<li>Malakai tells us the acronym for “Hemlock”, something goofy, and Clown hugs her dad</li>
<li>Breacher asks if I’m hiding some things and I say I’m not hiding some things, I’m hiding an entire arsenal of things; she gets pissed despite all they’ve let me in on and I say “weren’t you the one who told me I was a fool for not knowing who to trust?”; she’s still mad</li>
<li>Clown asks if I put the bug on her watch and I say “sure, lets go with that” (it was Marlow but I won’t rat him out)</li>
<li>Breacher sees a duck walking through her headquarters where her body is, then another, and another; another person in his HQ (Alek Wilde) shouts to fire guns at the ducks; the ducks vomit a dynamite stick, and Wilde says its Dingus McQuackin, a Minuteman who’s trying to assassinate Breacher</li>
<li>Breacher’s turrets are taking out as much as they can but she’s struggling; there’s nothing we can do</li>
<li>McQuackin was from 17th? century France and escaped an insane asylum (Damien’s from 14th century France, maybe no correlation but who knows); he was hired to assassinate Breacher by someone who we’ll need to find</li>
<li>Wilde asks if anyone else was at the compound and she says just a random rat who we realize was actually an agent (I learn people can Receptacle into rats)</li>
<li>We also hear about The Narwhal (not relevant but funny lore)</li>
<li>Clown reveals Alek Wilde is a mob boss</li>
<li>Breacher is convinced Rachel Anderson is the one who hired the assassin; Wilde gives her coords to Receptacle into in case they get to her body</li>
<li>Wilde tells us the top 4 candidates are
1. John Hannally from Chrono-Co (they’re moving away from Mr. Time, and Hannally’s close with Mr. Time)
2. Mr. Time
3. Breacher
4. Tracker (he was apparently 8 people’s 4th picks including mine LMAO)
5. Marlow MacPherson</li>
<li>Breacher mentions we need to talk about the brain breaking thing Ace did; she asks if we remember Tilda Clinton (I don’t remember her, and remembering her makes me take -6 temp damage); Ace erased her from existence</li>
<li>Tracker calls in to me and goes on a spiel about getting me Die Hard to make me feel better; I interrupt to roar “I’M GOING TO FUCKING KILL HIM” (about Ace); Tracker gets confused and think I’m talking about killing Samiel L. Jackson cause he was talking about Samuel L. Jackson</li>
<li>I interrupt Tracker to ask if he remember Tilda Clinton; he passes out before waking up, Tracker’s delirious and mentions something weird happening in a house in the Minutemen districts, temp stuff is going off and they’re trying to get Watchers to fix it; Tracker got his ass kicked trying to fix it while me and Clown were getting rescued; I have him send me coords; the computer by the bedroom is where it went down</li>
<li>Technically Tracker programmed him but as he’s remembering he says someone else might’ve done it; he didn’t buy Ace so Ace’s plans might have been set since the beginning</li>
<li>us Bloodhounds and the Clown (who might be a Bloodhound now) are planning how to trap Ace</li>
<li>Queue filler arc about Tracker binge watching pop culture movies with me</li>
<li>Clown casually says Paradox likes to turn her bones into jelly when she fails missions</li>
<li>Morgana asks what flavors of jelly and Enigma smacks her upside the head</li>
<li>I learn from them that Marlow’s tracker on Clown is known by Clown to be traced to Lone Master’s mansion on the dark side of the moon; they have no clue I am part of that mission and they want to find Marlow’s Counsilor</li>
<li>Bloodhounds have a private talk and Breacher learns Dalton doesn’t know about the chip</li>
<li>I learn that Tuhorn gave a tip that Holly Holland is the spark that starts the war so she must be kept alive</li>
<li>We get word that like 8 assassins are after Breacher Estuary Johnson: Sniper and Espinosa Jameson vibe. Former employee with Chrono-CO’s Aggressive Acquisitions division. Dingus McQuack: A guy who ties explosives to ducks and gets them to suicide bomb his enemies. Escaped insane asylum The Blade of Night: Teleporter with a shadow sword. Former Knight. Mobius: Hacker guy with electric weapons. From the 22nd century Earth originally. Tigress: Cat lady like Cheetah or Catra or Tigress from Carmen Sandiego or literally any other Cat themed villain The Rat: A time Traveller stuck in a rat who uses poisoned teeth to bite people The Butcher: Uses a butcher’s knife, former doctor, melee tank but also smart.</li>
<li>I learn about Deadman Switch, a plan where our info would go to each other if something happened, and if all of us went down we leak it to the press</li>
<li>I tell Breacher I’m the one who had Tracker give him a heads up about the Knights’ assassination; she didn’t know and is appreciative of me and Breacher</li>
<li>I tell them about all my spy clues (Breacher knows about Brad, and I reveal the clue about Spy #1 without giving away why I know it)</li>
<li>When an election happened for Madame E’s disappearance, Dalton recommended it and Tuhorn, the Eyes and the Lone Master opposed</li>
<li>Pete the chimp worked with Tasha and Morgana told Jane before she knew Jane was on the doom squad</li>
<li>They suspect Marlow is part of the doom squad, he could either be working for it or know nothing; him and the Lone Master are a mystery (I don’t reveal my info…)</li>
<li>I learn that Larry and Jane know things and have been working secretly to take down Tuhorn (they are probably pro-doom); Breacher also knows Larry is my Counsilor</li>
<li>They want me to keep everything under wraps; we plan to trap Ace, explore the house that Tracker talked about (maybe, the Ace squad will investigate it so maybe not),</li>
<li>I learn the Bloodhounds saw Selene at the Last Resort prior (she left so they couldn’t talk to her, she knew a bit about the situation but not everything); she had a black cat with her that they’re thinking is Madame E (they know Madame E Receptacled into something); the cat is also Miri’s</li>
<li>I learn the Bloodhounds during their first mission had karaoke with Malakai and the SecondHand</li>
<li>At this point the real Rosemary joined and we caught her up on what she canonically would’ve been in on</li>
<li>Rosemary knew Ace voted to kill me and told Morgana, who told me</li>
<li>Also Blorbo might just be a minion</li>
<li>I also realize that Clinton getting eviscerated is what opened up a second seat on the Counsil (Ryan still doesn’t know lmao)</li>
<li>Rachel Anderson might have Breacher’s invisible tech; the new model androids might have this tech built in</li>
<li>We have an amazing stupid ass plan to fill paint/water/pepper spray into something, take it to other timelines and spray anyone invisible since that substance outside of its time will count as an anomaly i can Time Sense and will act like marking paint on invis enemies
OBJECTIVES: Talk to Larry and Marlow separately to see where they lie (Bloodhounds don’t know), don’t tell the Knights about Ace, see if you can figure out if Damien and Brad are Hemlock
End of Session</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="attack-on-ac-001x-fri-628">Attack on AC-001X (Fri 6/28)</h1>
<ul>
<li>My Watch pings, and I receive a message from Breacher: &ldquo;Howdy Enigma, just letting you know that I am not infact dead its all a trap for AC, get to the central time engine where gonna force him to use the Hourglass and you&rsquo;ll be waiting to ambush him&rdquo;</li>
<li>I recruit Marlow MacPherson to help in the ambush, as he has abilities that can neutralize AC’s; I don’t tell him much, just enough to give him an idea</li>
<li>Word from Alec Wilde announces the death of Breacher at the hands of a minuteman assassin known as SMASH CUT; 100 credits go to any Minuteman who captures them alive for interrogation</li>
<li>A new sword-wielding Knight named Brendon Bells joins our crew (Bryce’s new character)</li>
<li>I am told me and Marlow need to beat up the Butcher, who was on the squad who “killed” Breacher; I do a stealth attack that deals some damage, I take 15 damage from a swipe; I was unable to defeat him (Marlow was unable to make it)</li>
<li>I convene with Morgana, the Magpie and Bells</li>
<li>AC’s abilities; turn into gun, instant transport to WatchTower (Hourglass), and summoning dinosaurs</li>
<li>One of the assassin’s that was sent to kill Breacher can’t be remembered…</li>
<li>Me, Magpie, Morgana, Jett (played by Bryce, Bells ain’t here) see AC enter the CTE, and we launch our attack</li>
<li>Morgana gets the jump and cold cases AC to stream what she sees on a remote server (she sees something privately that I don’t know about); she falls to the floor cause that’s what happens when she cold cases a robot but she gets her info</li>
<li>Magpie misses her shot, and AC in a despondent voice asks we don’t kill him, saying he will turn himself in; AC then puts temp handcuffs on himself, and erases himself from existence</li>
<li>Morgana’s footage has been tampered with, and the one shot that is left intact from the cold case is Anderson saying “do the cuffs work well?”</li>
<li>I take -16 temp damage just cause; I am stabilized</li>
<li>We stand around confused, not sure why we’re here; articles of Holly Holland’s moon mining still exist</li>
<li>ooc I learn that AC killed himself because if he didn’t, the bomb in me would’ve gone off (he didn’t know it had been taken out), he had been potentially legit taken by Anderson and reprogrammed; canonically I don’t even remember AC</li>
<li>Because of AC’s erasure, the Holly Holland leaks didn’t go out; that’s one less target on our backs, and Anderson no longer wants to assassinate us</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="knights-assault-on-hemlock-fri-628">Knights Assault on Hemlock (Fri, 6/28)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Me and Morgana are already at the CTE; our heads are aching, and Simon pinches his nose at me being already injured and needing healing (he gives me +8 health, I’m at 21 hp)</li>
<li>Morgana turns to the side and sees… herself? Poking around at purple fluid like she did in Greece…</li>
<li>We meet with High Paladin Creel, who tells us we must destroy Hemlock; we have access to their lair (&hellip; oops my bad); we see the three leaders, Malakai, Paradox (he has no image, there’s glyphs though that change based on how you perceive him), and robo-Stalin; we are to take down their operations once and for all and take down the leaders</li>
<li>Since my past mission sent them on edge, our goal is to cripple the base; a vista with lightning strikes is ahead, and beasts roam ahead; we must take the base and takeout anyone in the way</li>
<li>Creel seems weirdly anti-Hemlock right now</li>
<li>We are targeting everything, we need to overtake the fortress and get some data; make sure they don’t destroy anything too important</li>
<li>As we brief, we smell warm freshly baked cookies and the room gets colder; we see nothing but I feel a hand on my shoulder, I turn and I see what I recognize as Santa Claus (he’s gruff and jacked); he smiles at me and says “I have been assigned by the Watchers”; only I can see him, and he hands me a present since I’m on the nice list (the others see a present materialize); this is Nicholas Aurora (Manav)</li>
<li>Nich says he is with the Watchers, and Mr. Dingles his elf sidekick comes out and is someone who keeps track of everything for the Watchers; Dingles is visible to everyone but only I can see Nich</li>
<li>I tell Morgana to punch me before talking with him</li>
<li>Nich still visible only to me gives everyone a present; I tell them Nich says to open their gifts</li>
<li>Clown got a brand new makeup set for clown makeup, I get a giant gun (its a toy, like a nerf gun), Morgana gets a cartoonishly looking bomb that’s not lit and leaves it away, Simon gets a plastic hulk hand</li>
<li>I get the same time signals from him as I get from most things in the WatchTower (doesn’t mean a life signature, just something out of time which is… everything in the WatchTower)</li>
<li>We hear Damien led a squad earlier and turned off communication with Hemlock (spies on the inside have no contact); there’s 3 points of entry, a massive bridge that leads to a castle which has beasts along the way; a sneaky route near the moat that has some anomalies and weird temp fluid; the third is dropping in from the sky (Hemlock seems to have strange control over lightning, and there’s possible anti-air defense)</li>
<li>Me, Morgana and Clown are in agreement of making the mission look convincing but trying not to make it to successful (we don’t want Malakai being killed or even taken)</li>
<li>Me and Morgana decide we should take option 2 despite it being a slower route (totally didn’t plan that on purpose)</li>
<li>Creel kind of puts me in charge given how high ranking I am with the Knights (and Damien isn’t here); I call for us to use the second squadron to attack on the bridge with Chrono-Co bots as a distraction while we do the stealth mission</li>
<li>I make a private call with MacIntyre and learn automatons shot at people in downtown which is where MacIntyre is; he vaguely recalls working with someone (my head aches at the mention of Clinton); I ask what the best course of action is and am unable to tip him off that I know about the doom squad and his place with Hemlock, but he says the most efficient course of action is to follow Creel (so don’t in Enigma’s mind) and go after Paradox rather than Malakai</li>
<li>Morgana can see Nich (he becomes visible to Watchers?)</li>
<li>Marlow joins us (FINALLY); Creel gives a rousing speech before we head off to the Hemlock HQ</li>
<li>I tell Morgana about what MacIntyre told me, and we see in the distance a giant looming bug known as Jeremy</li>
<li>The automatons already took out Puerto Rico</li>
<li>Marlow has a stealth cloaker that gives us a +2 to stealth</li>
<li>We see one Jeremy ant ahead, there’s 3 total</li>
<li>Marlow gives us some demolition equipment (I get one)</li>
<li>Nick has a naughty and nice list and Jeremy #3 is crossed out (the one we killed last time lmao)</li>
<li>We stealth but Simon gets caught and tries chucking a rock or something idk; Marlow breaks cover and sees the ants can spit acid, he’s gonna get his shit rocked but he takes the L to help Simon; the ant strikes at him and he dodges; the rest of us are bought time to make our way to the wall</li>
<li>I Time Sense and see the whole fortress is a temporal abomination and nothing that’s here should be here (goddamn); Morgana looks for secret entrances</li>
<li>We saddle along the wall (it eats up time… not that we’re complaining); droppers from above are getting shredded but some are making it</li>
<li>Simon and Marlow are struggling with the Jeremy, and we advise that Marlow <em><strong>not</strong></em> beat it over the head with his cane and instead him and Simon try to hide so they don’t get killed (while drawing it away); they escape to the crags under cover</li>
<li>Marlow opens his pocket watch, empties his explosives, and creates a trap that explodes the walls of the crag on the Jeremy; Simon heals up Marlow and sends a drone hand (he got it recently) to scout the tunnel pathings of the base; the Jeremy attacks</li>
<li>Marlow lures over the other Jeremies and detonates the bomb, causing the walls to come around and incomapsicate/kill them</li>
<li>In the castle a hangar door opens up and a dragon comes out (like at the debates, the same kind that killed Ross Perot)</li>
<li>As the dragon flies out, we see a group of Knights fighting it off; among them is Damien in all his glory (NPC)</li>
<li>Marlow and Simon regroup, and head to us; Creel chimes in on our comms and says we need to flank on the bridge</li>
<li>We’re in the hangar and Marlow and Simon are regrouped with us (we weren’t able to get info before they came back); they see a goon ahead and Nick tries to stab him but misses cause the goon goes down to tie his shoe; he then pushes the goon off the wall</li>
<li>There are turrets and Nick is in control (the goon was manning them); he lowers a rope for us and we climb up</li>
<li>We see more beasts, more Jeremies, beasts in tubes and scientists running around managing it; these creatures are weapons being prepared</li>
<li>In the distance we see all three leaders talking; Malakai talks about making an escape route</li>
<li>Paradox is two doctors who speak in unison and talks about “funny things” (Clown)</li>
<li>Malakai is going down a hall to the right, Paradox is going left, staying in the hangar is robo-Stalin, and down the hall straight ahead is the area that leads to us regrouping with Creel’s Knights per orders</li>
<li>We argue and decide we will avoid Paradox, the group will regroup with Creel and me, Marlow and Clown will go after Malakai</li>
<li>We do a gamble (I say I wanna hit 12 for success on tailing Malakai and get a NAT 12 +3 LETS GOOO); me and Clown are able to tail and Marlow isn’t able to get past robo-Stalin blessedly</li>
<li>Nick and Marlow roll badly and get caught by robo-Stalin; Stalin monologues while dragging along a hammer and laser sickle because he’s a Soviet</li>
<li>two Jeremies are now locked onto Nick (we canonize that they’re the new “Tuhorn Direction”)</li>
<li>Marlow finds all sorts of stuff around him, and avoids direct confrontation with robo-Stalin</li>
<li>Nicholas dropped lore earlier that Santa Claus is a new guy and he’s the real Saint Nick; not important just funny</li>
<li>Nick and Marlow are fighting robo-Stalin and the Jeremies, Morgana and Simon are further ahead on the bridge to regroup with Creel</li>
<li>Tracker fires from his machine gun setup and takes down one of the Jeremies; Marlow strikes at robo-Stalin with some energy stuff which Stalin seems vulnerable to; he’s doing well but is hurt</li>
<li>Tracker and his squad get hit by the last remaining Jeremy</li>
<li>Marlow is able to grab on to something and tries to pull him over the railing; he is unable to succeed and gets knocked down by robo-Stalin’s double whammy sickle and hammer smack down</li>
<li>Simon reels back to bring Marlow up and he is able to hack one of the jets in the facility</li>
<li>Tacker successfully dives away from a Jeremy attack</li>
<li>Nick goes to Tracker and his squad and the Jeremy; he strikes with his sword</li>
<li>Stalin reaches Marlow and Simon; Marlow fends off Stalin by aiming for the mustache with an energy pistol while Simon tries getting the jet up (he fails)</li>
<li>Nick fails to use his Marlow-given explosive to take down the Jeremy; Tracker gets another hit in</li>
<li>Marlow tries to do mind games and says “just the fact that you’re here fighting me means that you’ve already lost”; he tries shoving him off again, but fails and instead Stalin shoves <em>him</em> off the ledge; he takes damage below</li>
<li>Simon shoots at the Jeremy and is able to bring up Marlow</li>
<li>Tracker and the goon squad get their jet up and running, and Nick tells him he’s imbued with the spirit of Christmas; Tracker says “thanks… Santa?”</li>
<li>Simon tries flying a jet into Stalin (Marlow ducks) and injures him; Simon is in a state in the cockpit of the jet and Stalin walks out of the fire shouting “MARLOOOWWWW”; two ants break out of their capsules and come over…</li>
<li>Tracker and the goon squad are on standby, Nick invisible goes over to pry open the cockpit and get Simon out…</li>
<li>Marlow dodges blows from Stalin, Simon falls unconscious from the fumes and Nick struggles to get him out; he uses his Watch to slow time and pop open the hatch; he gets Simon and the Jeremies run towards them</li>
<li>Marlow strikes robo-Stalin in one final hail merry, and he falls defeated; Marlow heads for the jets</li>
<li>The two Jeremies down Marlow and Nick as the only not downed one throws his snowglobe on his floor before throwing Simon through into his workshop (he’ll get stabilized by elves or Ms. Aurora or whatever)</li>
<li>Tracker tries running back to get Marlow up and gets downed by the Jeremies; Simon is safe but only Nick is up (Tracker and Marlow are down)</li>
<li>Nick does some magic shit and tricks one of the Jeremies into wandering away; Marlow is on three death saves, Tracker is on three after Nick is able to stabilize Marlow</li>
<li>Nick FINALLY gets a success (Nat 12) and summons some shit to up Tracker (he’s very delirious)’ though very delirious he’s able to fly a jet and they get out of there</li>
<li>At this point Anu arrives only AFTER we go through the whole robo-Stalin fight (Stalin is dead)</li>
<li>Clown reveals to us that Damien is def Hemlock and really really hates Creel; she knows this cause they went to evil therapy together but Damien stopped coming</li>
<li>Damien meets up with Morgana and high fives her; she debriefs him and says the goal is to take over the fortress; the bridge is where the fighting is taking place; they plan to have the Knights distract the Hemlock so Morgana can sneak a bomb around so everyone can break in after the door blows up</li>
<li>Damien shouts out “Hemlock, prepare to meet your doom!” with bravado to distract; his charm is so high they don’t even shoot him out of confusion while Morgana sneaks by</li>
<li>As morgana’s in trouble, Damien tells everyone to point their guns at Morgana; he reveals himself as a Hemlock agent (he says “AC you were right” and remembers him)</li>
<li>We catch up to Malakai, and Clown introduces herself; as she’s talking to him, I pull out a gun on Malakai; he is Hemlock, he is the enemy, he can’t be trusted… how can I trust him?</li>
<li>Him and the Clown say hope. Its what we have… I put my gun down in frustration</li>
<li>Timeline stabilization is theoretically possible and Chrono-Co would have it; Holly Holland put me in alt timelines and I’m stable so its possible</li>
<li>I ask if Damien Beyowolf Trayer is in fact Hemlock, and he’s a bit obsessed with hurting Creel (he wants to tear apart the Knights); Paradox might have been talking to him</li>
<li>I also learn Brad is in fact a traitor but he’s “kind” (I make Clown cover her ears for this)</li>
<li>We roll tech checks so I can get info from the servers and wipe it out so the WatchTower can’t receive it</li>
<li>Malakai before he leaves tells us Damien is kidnapping Morgana</li>
<li>Clown wishes her father goodbye, and i give him a look and say “about this hope… you better be right about this” with a look of threat, desperation, and even hope</li>
<li>I give Clown a busted lip, and she gives me a black eye for convincing’s sake (she knocks me with a comically large glove)</li>
<li>Right as the Hemlock are about to tie up Morgana, me and Clown tp right behind her; I ask him what the hell he’s doing and we argue (mf calls me a “side chick” in this as its not personal between us but him and Creel, and I say he’s been my side chick if anything)</li>
<li>7 years old when time pirates killed and raided his village while Knights didn’t do enough to save people; he was French and sent to the Knights; he thinks they’re a disease with nothing good of them; he talks of his first Knights infantry who were killed at 13 in a squadron</li>
<li>At this point Damien is monologuing his whole life story about how he had to watch the people he loved getting killed while having to be the face of the Knights, recruiting people to their deaths</li>
<li>I ask Damien if he believes no one is worth saving, not Bastil, Clown, me… he says we’re just three people who’ve lived of hundreds who have died</li>
<li>I tell Damien that I don’t know who i can trust, but I know I don’t want to see the people I care about die; I won’t allow him to do so</li>
<li>During this time Morgana was sneaking around and placing the bombs</li>
<li>I walk with Morgana and as I leave I say “I know what it feel like… being a temporal refugee. Because I was one of them” and I tp me and Morgana out</li>
<li>Clown tries to reason with Damien, and does a montage ability where she puts him and her in a simulation; they’re doing meditation in the Himalayas and going to therapy; they start building a mech at some point (all to help him realize he’s being overtaken by revenge to kill Creel)</li>
<li>The Knights are getting through the door; Damien is contemplating helping prevent the Knights from getting killed on the bridge and betraying Hemlock, or sticking with Hemlock and pursuing Creel’s death</li>
<li>Damien makes a decision; he puts on a mech, sits between Knights and Hemlock, and tells all sides to lower their guns and choose peace; Creel walks up to him and agrees, and tells him to step aside so they can finish the mission</li>
<li>Damien publicly challenges Creel in front of everyone and says he wishes for the Knights to be not of warfare but of enlightenment (Clown therapy did wonders); his speech is rousing but Creel is determined; they go back and forth and Creel is losing his nerve, and takes off his helmet for the first time showing himself to be a normal man, and reveals that Paladin Creel isn’t actually a consistent person but a title with a different person they hire to be “High Paladin Creel”</li>
<li>Creel calls him a “pretentious fuck” and says they’re all fighting to die</li>
<li>I walk up to Creel, he says “not now”, I say “bad time?” mockingly, he punches me in the face, and I spit out blood with a smirk and say “fuckin’ worth it”</li>
<li>I notice a lot of these Knights, regular people, confused, and trying their best…</li>
<li>Also Damien’s 17 #Damienigma is fucking dead</li>
<li>Damien gives another speech, and rouses the Knights; Creel gives him his helmet to do whatever and quits</li>
<li>Tracker says some delirious shit and passes out; Damien asks Clown to heal Tracker and Clown suddenly walks up to Tracker with her Funny Gun loaded and shoots at him (blessedly she misses with a Nat 1); she’s seemingly doing this against her will</li>
<li>Morgana is able to knock her off course so her attacks don’t hit Tracker; the gun says “SUMMON” and a dog and a gun appear</li>
<li>I tp to Tracker and get him out (-2)</li>
<li>Damien kills the puppy; we hear laughter behind the Clown that says “don’t worry I’m satisfied for now, see you later Clown” before disappearing (fucking Paradox)</li>
<li>I learn that Clown is being told to do things by Paradox and when she’s denied it before, he’d pout and hurt her; this is the first time he’s overtaken her directly… we need to deal with him and fast</li>
<li>Damien shaves off his hair and put Creel’s helmet on a sword</li>
<li>We learn that the Funny Gun’s design isn’t meant to be lethal generally, but sometimes it is</li>
<li>I learn that Clown accidentally turned Jack the Ripper into a ninjutsu master at some point</li>
<li>Damien becomes a hippie with Clown wanting to join in (so long as she gets to feed her cats)</li>
<li>I am pulled aside to a private conversation with Nicholas Aurora; he opens his snowglobe pocket dimension and I see snow around a cozy little cottage; I hear the crackling of a fireplace and smell freshly baked cookies</li>
<li>In front of me is Nick in a big red chair; he hands me a cookie and I sit; he welcomes me to his estate. I comment “cozy estate”</li>
<li>He says since we’re working together, he wants to bring me in the loop; he asks me if I know all the Watcher Counsilors, and as I list them off he stops me at the mention of “the Eyes Unseen”; he says i know two things, that the Eyes exists… and then he points at himself. He is the Eyes Unseen</li>
<li>I point this out and he laughs, saying good job; he’s been following my work and says only children can see me and I was given permission as he’s impressed with me</li>
<li>I ask what he trusts me to do, and he trusts me to have his back; he wasn’t originally WatchTower but our Counsilors contacted him eons ago to join with his network of elves who have eyes all over the world</li>
<li>He’s seen many betrayals and wishes for the people (the children) to be protected; he doesn’t care about the affairs of the WatchTower, merely protecting people</li>
<li>Mrs. Aurora comes in with cookies and milk, I can’t see her face as she’s shrouded in snow (similar to how Unseen is invis); I thank her, and Nick says she must like me as she only makes milk for those she likes</li>
<li>Mrs. Aurora gave him milk and cookies and they healed Simon; I warily eat a cookie and its the most delicious cookies in the world</li>
<li>Only me, Mrs. Aurora and the elves know his secret; I promise to keep it</li>
<li>I agree to his partnership, even if I break some rules; he says wonderful, and i feel my vision flooded with snow and I wake up at the Plaza</li>
<li>Fixing the time war tech is theoretical, fixing alternate timelines we know works; SecondHand believes they can prevent the time war
Info from the computers:</li>

<ol>
<li>Paradox is an entity of the mind. Just knowing about him makes him stronger, and the more you believe in him and the more you fear what he can do, the more he <em>can</em> do. If you go into a battle paranoid he might have an ace up his sleeve, he&rsquo;s guaranteed to have one. He does have a special gimmick though: when you try to make a deal with him, he has to make an offer, and if you accept he can&rsquo;t reneg.</li>
<li>You have the clues for all the spies already: 1 = Going to Therapy (Clown) 2 = A New Watcher (Brad) 4 = Running for Councilor (Damien). There is no information on Spy 3, it looks like they were numbered 1, 2, and 4 as a joke.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t know Holly Holland&rsquo;s death is the spark, that&rsquo;s just a theory. All you know is that the Watchers want it to happen and within 12 days, war breaks out.</li>

<li>Team: Morgana, Miri, Sidney Stockton, Magpie, Rosemary</li>
<li>I joined late to learn that Magpie talked to Selene, something about her trying to save us by going in the belly of the beast
Morgana’s Catch Up Notes</li>

<li><strong>Cat Convo</strong></li>
<li>Not a receptacle</li>
<li>Saw Selene slightly before she last saw Tasha</li>
<li>Selene ran downstairs, below the house.</li>
<li>8-9 sleeps ago. So when the 21 days dates from</li>
<li>So around the deathday</li>
<li>Tasha wrote &ldquo;21 days&rdquo; close to the time of her death</li>
<li>21 days could be a calendar.</li>
<li>Cat: Does not remember seeing Malcolm</li>
<li>Went down to the basement, got placed on a disk and got a little bit woozy, and then no memories after that</li>
<li>Then being taken off the disc, and Tasha comes down, pops out a tube and gets worried and writing stuff and putting up the</li>
<li>So some of the post-its came after Selene and cat visited the resort.</li>
<li>Conjecture: Was someone receptacled into the cat.</li>
<li>So Tasha was receptacled into the cat, or possibly Madame E.</li>
<li>Any bouts of wooziness since then: &ldquo;Not that I can remember&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Selene Letter</strong></li>
<li>I hope you can forgive me</li>
<li>May have to leave at short notice</li>
<li>Only way to keep you safe</li>
<li>She left this at LRS intentionally</li>
<li>So she&rsquo;s been leaving a trail for Miri, and she figured that one of Miri&rsquo;s friends would be at LRS at this time</li>
<li><strong>Leads</strong></li>

<li>So it&rsquo;s a secondhander</li>
<li>&ldquo;What do you mean? Being followed?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Watchers?&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;We only have 30 minutes, been a good run, given lack of capsule.&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Get parts back to base, should be good to go&rdquo;</li>
<li>Pocketwatch what we can, and carry the rest.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Detective? Looking into you? Are they one of Tasha&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</li>
<li>I think she was off to the temple</li>
<li>&ldquo;Bury the rest&rdquo;</li>
<li>10 minutes: Circling looking for a temple</li>
<li>Two buildings with fountains, one is obviously a temple.</li>
<li><strong>Temple</strong></li>

<li>Someone showing up in purple at an altar of Minerva</li>
<li>There are a few time travellers and someone with a pocketwatch</li>
<li>Person is Frida Aldeman!</li>
<li><strong>Magpie Update</strong></li>
<li>They shared a video. Probably not doctored</li>
<li>With one minute left - Frida pulled out a masquerade mask, looked directly at the magpie,</li>
<li>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the one they sent? I thought they&rsquo;d send the kid but I&rsquo;m okay with that&rdquo;</li>

<li>TODO where is this</li>
<li>Check out Holland, find Holland&rsquo;s engineers and you&rsquo;ll find Selene</li>
<li>So we have vault combo</li>
<li>Ok apparently we don&rsquo;t.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Morgana says she met Frieda Aleman, leader of SecondHand, in Pompeii; they set off some bombs and prevented Frieda from dying, and she keeps giving hints to Miri</li>
<li>Last Resort gave hints that Tasha is working for SecondHand; this group now knows about the doomsday operation and how SecondHand wants to stop it</li>
<li>I come to Miri’s mansion by request of Morgana; Miri doesn’t want to let me in cause I’m scary lmao</li>
<li>We need to talk to the Egypt squad cause they have some clue about the Pyramids of Giza for a vault we need to open; Breacher was there so we could ask her</li>
<li>Rosemary comes outside and waits with me on the porch; Miri is able to figure out the date of the Egypt mission</li>
<li>I am let in and the vault opens; its full of junk but there is art of a blueprint for a temporal stabilizer; its way too complex for me to understand, it could be understood by an expert; its split in a way where there’s some parts but not everything is here; Tasha has been slowly stealing Chrono-Co tech to amass a collection</li>
<li>Miri recognizes some of this tech, its Watcher tech that threads timelines together and its reverse engineered (which would destabilize?); if hypothetically Leonardo da Vinci were to get drugged, this tech would be used to fix that</li>
<li>If you wanted to destroy a temporal stabilizer, this has ⅓ of what you’d need</li>
<li>I am familiar with temp stabilizers that weave stuff into to timelines; this has weaving stuff out; this would split a timeline into strands and make them easier to work with</li>
<li>Clue about finding Holland’s engineer will bring us to Selene; Rosemary knows a guy in Chrono-Co, Billiam Beggerton the engineer; she calls him up; Rose mentions talking to Cecilia Dalton, and Beggerton says Holland kind of wants to kill Rosemary</li>
<li>Morgana tells me Sidney may be SecondHand, she’s been working with Tuhorn and is sympathetic to wanting to keep the world from ending</li>
<li>Beggerton works on smartwatches not mines so he’s probably not the one we’re looking for; I would recognize some people from the mines</li>
<li>We get from Beggerton some mining engineer connections; we make sure he won’t tell anyone, and he gives me a list (he also says people become pricks when they get promoted lmao); one guy got fired recently, something with an “H”, Harry or Harrison, Hairy Harry was his nickname; Beggerton says he might be a dissonant (its a rumor)</li>
<li>Rosemary texts Hairy Harry and accidentally gets on his bad side (he doesn’t like the nickname; I facepalm); she feigns ignorance at knowing he was fired and mentions she is no longer under Holland but Dalton; he says he did so much work for Holly and one mess up got him demoted, he isn’t actually fired but he’s in such a low position he might as well have been</li>
<li>He agrees to meet Rosemary at a pub; I tell her to be wary of the threat rumors about Holland wanting her dead, that she needs to stay safe and not compromise herself; she tells me not to worry, she’s got this</li>
<li>They meet at the pub, and we sit in a nearby booth disguised (Morgana dresses as a cis person)</li>
<li>2 days ago Harry got the unofficial boot, he runs routine server maintenance now (very low position); he says they were designing something in the mines, he made an elevator with a secret button and some “Watcher brat” was able to turn the key and get to the secret floor (Miri…)</li>
<li>Rosemary talks bad about Watchers for keeping up appearances and I glare at her for rp and SAM MADE ME DO A ROLL (I passed tho so I didn’t get caught)</li>
<li>Harry says</li>
<li>The Knights are able to go through alternate timelines; Rosemary brings it up and he tells her not to talk about it so loudly; Chrono-Co apparently is getting into that business (we know this but Rosemary didn’t); he says Holland has “long arms” (metaphor for like eyes everywhere) in response to Rosemary saying Holland can’t touch her cause she’s under Dalton</li>
<li>Rosemary needs coordinates to see the alt timeline operations but she’d need them from Holly, who we do not want contact with right now</li>
<li>Harry had to sign an NDA so he’s sure they won’t fully fire him; he’s working on random stuff around Chrono-Co including Dalton’s elevator; Rosemary promises to try and get him his position back, and he promises to give us a list of the other engineers, whose apartment are getting vacated</li>
<li>Rosemary successfully gets him drunk and he slips some NDA info; Chono-Co didn’t take his stuff, they didn’t delete his work and he still has access to it, he just has to tell Holly what he finds and not leak any of what he has on his computer to anyone</li>
<li>Sidney and Magpie head to Hairy’s house while Rosemary distracts him; Miri, Morgana and me stay at the pub (I would be perfect to go to the house but I’m laying low since Holly’s involved)</li>
<li>There are Chrono-Co people surrounding his house</li>
<li>Sidney uses an animal talking ability to speak to a dog, who tells him the front desk person doesn’t like dogs being in the lobby; she unclips the dog and the lobby person is distracted; Sidney and Magpie sneak by</li>
<li>In Harry’s office is some designs capsule tech, hand drawings of mech stuff but seems like its just Harry’s hobby, a cat in the corner, and the laptop</li>
<li>Sidney finds from the laptop security questions; we need his mother’s maiden name, first grade teacher and pet name</li>
<li>Sidney talks to the cat and its very despondent; she’s able to get it to believe she’s a catsitter; his name is Proxima 3 and he’s an apathetic asshole who demands “food, peasant”</li>
<li>”Proxima” gets through the pet question; Magpie isn’t able to find a yearbook for the teacher but she finds stuff on Harry’s grandmother Eleanor Hustace; Hustace passes the mother’s maiden name question; Rosemary pries for the teacher’s nickname from Harry; she asks it way too obviously but the dice gods are actually her patrons cause even with disadvantage she gets no less than a fucking 11; Harry drunkenly goes on about how there was a ham incident where he brought too much ham to an event so he was the “ham guy”</li>
<li>Rosemary tells Harry a story about how in first grade she collected Easter eggs and she sees sixth graders walking kindergarteners and they see the first graders and started pouncing on them to get the eggs or something idk this really isn’t relevant but I’ve committed to transcribing everything, anyway he reveals its Mrs. Cassidy she’s the final security question</li>
<li>Sidney and Magpie are able to download the files and sneak back out; Magpie is invis as usual but the lobby person is still around and Sidney needs to sneak out; she gets 15 and diverolls and flips around flawlessly out of the lobby</li>
<li>We see info about engineers being relocated to a luxury spot in a timeline, where they will be in charge of the society there; there’s a second timeline with the mines</li>
<li>With the coords, we have backdoor access to the alt timelines</li>
<li>ooc Morgana tells me Aunt Mildred is a SecondHand agent that was in Pompeii; Morgana was accidentally the reason Tuhorn is in hot water from the Council
End of Session
OBJECTIVE: Use the stabilizer blueprints to look into it; talk to Larry Mortz; contact MacIntyre</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="secret-meeting-with-clown-sun-630">Secret Meeting With Clown (Sun 6/30)</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Clown summons morgana and I for a secret meeting</li>
<li>Its a quaint apartment, and her two cats do indeed exist (her funds go to feeding them)</li>
<li>I bring up Paradox and Clown reveals to me that Paradox isn’t a god (eldritch being for sure); she tells me about his abilities that I know of from the computer</li>
<li>Breacher can’t help because she believes Paradox is a god, and that belief gives him power; we have to ensure we don’t believe in him</li>
<li>Clown reveals that she brought back Greece, Paradox pulled some funny stuff through Clown to make it seem like Florence had come back, and that belief gave Paradox the power to actually bring him back</li>
<li>Paradox had it planned from the beginning to make people think he was more powerful than he was, until the belief in his power gave him legitimate power</li>
<li>When Clown lowers her belief in what Paradox can do, it lowers his actual power; hence why he’s not here at the moment; because Clown doesn’t let him have that power (our fear during the Hemlock siege is what gave him the power to overtake Clown)</li>
<li>We must see him for who he is; a weak being who relies on others for power</li>
<li>Clown has a <em>last resort</em> plan in case we fail; she will raze the WatchTower and kill the people in power so she will become the villain, and we can pick up the pieces</li>
<li>I tell her this plan is heavy, and she sombers for the first time since I’ve seen; she says she doesn’t want to hurt people, she joined Hemlock because villains can be legit evil, but usually villains in history are scapegoats; Hemlock knows they’re the bad guys, and can take the brunt of the fire from the WatchTower so the factions don’t attack themselves; with Paradoxes power, she would destroy the factions entirely</li>
<li>She called us because she’s worried, and would like to prevent that last resort plan; last time she tried to talk about it to her dad he was unable to provide much</li>
<li>I repeat my line about if the fighting goes on, Hemlock goes on</li>
<li>I am against the idea of the Watchers no longer existing, but with her plan the Watchers wouldn’t need to exist; its a horrible plan but its better than all of everything getting destroyed</li>
<li>Clown says her and her dad are all that would be left of humanity; she knows I understand the pain of a timeline being wiped (I give a warning glare but listen); she needs to prevent it, so there’s something left to rebuild… I understand it.</li>
<li>If Mr. Time knows about Paradox and fear mongers about it we’re fucked</li>
<li>After seeing the Knights siege and everything with Damien, Clown has hope the factions can change</li>
<li>If we could destroy Paradox, Clown says she could theoretically bring him back in the event the WatchTower armageddon occurs</li>
<li>I bring up the contract, and Clown says she sees 3 ways of defeating Paradox; one involves striking a deal that would destroy him, but it does require one of us making a deal (also we need to be tricky); he can prepare a counteroffer if we make a deal (ex. We tell him to die and he tells us he accepts but if we destroy the WatchTower); option 2 is to fundamentally change his nature (if we could convince enough people he’s a kind benevolent weak being, he would be and we could guilt him into destroying himself); option 3 is to fight head on (its very unpredictable so its dangerous)</li>
<li>Clown doesn’t quite trust my morals while she trusts Morgana’s (she says this outloud, she wanted to be honest); but she does trust us to have this talk</li>
<li>If Clown has to do the last resort, she needs to make sure there will be people here to rebuild the WatchTower and kill her; people like us, who would be able to take charge and prevent this from ever happening again</li>
<li>I am upset on Clown’s behalf, and demand to know why she’s alright with this; she says she’s not happy, she is upset, but she’s already living on borrowed time and she’s all who can do it; I understand</li>
<li>She also asks that we take care of her cats if it comes down to this</li>
<li>She tells us one last thing, something Paradox may attack us with; she says Clown is sort of a sleeper cell, and “crocodile” is a code word; another code phrase is one that would make Clown forget everything she knows of the WatchTower; if she’s ever acting weird or like she doesn’t remember anything, we say “crocodile” and she’ll be back to normal</li>
<li>Morgana tells her about timeline stabilization tech (she talked to a frenchman in the Last Resort, Quade most likely, and he told her and her group some of the blueprints); we say we want Clown to work with Quade to see if they can make sense of these blueprints and figure out timeline stabilization</li>
<li>Once the timeline is stable there’s a chance Clown will cease to exist</li>
<li>When Clown was at her lowest, she talked to her dad and learned that even if the plan doesn’t fully fix the timeline or the WatchTower, as long as we have something, its something we have; even if we stave the war off for 2 or 3 years, that’s 2 or 3 years to live longer and maybe even find a better way</li>
<li>Clown muses that because the WatchTower is out of time, there’s a chance these plans to prevent the war have already happened once with other people or even other versions of us</li>
<li>Morgana confirms 13 days from now something will happen, and the actual bombs that go off and destroy everything happens in 10 or so years</li>
<li>Clown believes Paradox really wants what happens in 13 days to happen</li>
<li>I get defensive over Clown saying the Watchers (particularly the pro-doom squad ones) most likely won’t change their minds and we’ll have to kill them (I think of Larry and Marlow, who are most likely pro-dom squad); Morgana and I are hesitant, but Clown insist we at least have to be prepared to fight them</li>
<li>Clown says we need to make sure Breacher doesn’t think about Paradox, and doesn’t worry about him; this will not be easy</li>
<li>We make Clown reveal that rumors are there that Chrono-Co has tech that can temporarily erase people from the timeline; its not definitive but theoretically if someone is erased with this method they could be brought back; I bring up the Rachel Anderson footage that was left from Morgana’s cold case footage after [REDACTED], and my bringing up the cuffs makes Clown remember that it was temp cuffs that these rumors were about</li>
<li>Clown said in Chrono-Co she saw lasers that would supposedly agonizingly kill someone but actually transports them somewhere else where they live their lives, and upon the moment they will die they’re transported back to the moment they were shot with the laser and are killed for real after living a whole life</li>
<li>I deduce that the reason for the temporary part is that someone could live their whole lives in secrecy plotting and planning while everyone else thinks they’re dead so no one tries to stop them</li>
<li>Clown says she believes this tech wasn’t finalized as Chrono-Co usually shows her their stuff and she hasn’t seen a finished product (this tech isn’t Paradoxes style); but its possible she was kept in the dark; this tech would have most likely been used to enslave people but also for plotting</li>
<li>Clown brings up that we could possibly utilize this tech, and I determined to use the stability tech to make sure she can be stabilized</li>
<li>Oh also Gallaway is Paradox APPARENTLY (not Clown’s fault, last time she tried to tell someone he broke all the bones in her body); Paradox has a Council seat at Chrono-Co</li>
<li>I am stressing about the implications and Morgana gives Clown a look to cool it; Clown quickly gives me her cat Charles for anxiety relief (I sigh and allow it)</li>
<li>Clown shows us her evil warlord hitlist (as in influential people to kill if she wants the WatchTower to be destroyed and destabilized in the event we have to do Clown’s last result): #2 is Holly Holland, #1 is Will Dalton (not because he’s evil, but because him dying has a bigger effect)</li>
<li>Clown spins in her chair and suggests that if Holly’s death is a spark, if we temp erase her the day she’s supposed to be killed, her death wouldn’t happen and she’d come back after that window has passed</li>
<li>We tell Clown we appeared at the CTE not remembering anything (I connect the cold case footage of Anderson saying “will this work” being about temp handcuffs); we can try to find the cuffs Anderson was looking for</li>
<li>Clown thinks we could maybe put temp erasing handcuffs on Paradox, which would erase him from all of time; Clown will get this info from Mr. Time since they’re buddies (we’re not sure if the cuffs will work on him, but its the most definitive action we have and it WILL fuck with him)</li>
<li>I learn after telling Clown the footage is of Anderson that all her automatons are equipped with temp cuffs that would either temp or permanently erase people</li>
<li>Morgana convinces me to let Clown bug-check our equipment; we find out our tech was riddled with bugs; we have Watcher bugs on everything, meaning they’ll know where we were depending on when they were placed (Last Resort, Pompeii, Yosemite)</li>
<li>I finally admit that Marlow bugged her funny gun and I knew about it; the Clown is in danger potentially so I needed to reveal it, and that I took the fall (I tell them I wish to talk to him about it and believe he may not know about the doom plan)</li>
<li>She says she’s good at crying and cried once when Breacher shouted at her and she cried herself to sleep when I punched her (I am intensely uncomfortable and Morgana apologizes on her behalf); she says she cries to get her emotions out and I am guilt tripped into getting ice cream with the group (Morgana evil grins at me and says “ice cream?” knowing I feel too guilty to say no after the Clown admitted I made her cry and I knew about Marlow bugging her shit; I want to murder Morgana)</li>
<li>”I’ll be honest, I didn’t think Trayer was capable of long term revenge. I didn’t think he was capable of long term memory” - Enigma</li>
<li>I realize that Larry most likely knows I’m kind of a traitor since I let Malakai and Damien go (our bugs might have shown me giving away that game)</li>
<li>I tell Morgana about me letting Malakai go and him being the reason we knew to rescue her from Damien (we also sort of acknowledge that we’re friends); I also tell her about what I got from him and the computers</li>
<li>”Holly Holland is the spark and the last camel on the arc” is a clue Morgana got from Tuhorn about Holly being the spark to the war; I tell her about all my info from the Hemlock siege; I theorize that Holly’s death is a wave, and Morgana thinks we need to keep her alive</li>
<li>we have some fun talking about ways to kill Holly Holland; she realizes at some point I started calling him “Malakai” (I won’t spill about where I got my “so long as the fight goes on, hemlock goes on” line from Larry and Malakai)</li>
<li>I ponder how Riley knew me at the Last Resort</li>
<li>We go over notes; Selene was at the Last Resort with a cat that was owned by Tasha that was left to her and then Miri with the will; this morning Ace squad spoke with the cat and learned it was on a time pod and has no memory; Tasha sent the cat and Selene and Receptacled into the cat at the Last Resort (she might have been hiding from Watchers); she left a note for Miri who told the group some of it, morgana believes she’s hiding some but here are what Morgana knows:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I hope you can forgive me</li>
<li>May have to leave at short notice</li>
<li>Only way to keep you safe</li>
<li>She left this at LRS intentionally</li>
<li>So she&rsquo;s been leaving a trail for Miri, and she figured that one of Miri&rsquo;s friends would be at LRS at this time</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>i learn that LRS is Last Resort and Spa (I remember the hand towel from Florence and Tasha’s will reading and tell Morgana such); i tell her about Florence with the 1704 briefcase from 19th century, the LRS hand towel, bullet casings from the 20th and the kaleidoscope (I say that someone I worked with [don’t mention its Marlow] had an interest in it but I don’t know why)</li>
<li>my kaleidoscope is similar to Miri’s and the one stolen by Tasha when she died</li>
<li>ooc Sidney runs a blog apparently
OBJECTIVES: Me and Morgana try to get the cuffs from the footage of Anderson, Clown will get cuffs and info from Mr. Time and go over the stabilizing blueprints with Quaid at the Last Resort</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="talk-with-larry-73-wed">Talk With Larry (7/3; Wed)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Morgana and I are summoned by Jane Doe and Larry Mortz</li>
<li>Larry apologizes about “false pretenses”; he says he needed us for something important and sensitive</li>
<li>We follow him inside Watcher HQ; its a bit polygonic, with obsidian walls and triangle patterns</li>
<li>We go to a room that says Projection Room; he says he needs to show us something; Morgana gets snarky when she’s nervous so she makes a comment about “bringing popcorn” and I elbow her; Larry returns her jest in good nature</li>
<li>Jane Doe was apparently at the Florence mission and I met her briefly; she was the one with a gas mask</li>
<li>We take our seats; Jane has a cane that I see, she’s a master of disguise and she doesn’t need it but its sort of her thing to have a cane</li>
<li>Larry scans me for any Chrono-Co bugs (from me being in Chrono-Co custody); he finds something in my watch; he hands it to someone in a trenchcoat to sort it out…</li>
<li>The tape is rolled to show us something we could “shed some light on”; Holly Holland is walking through the mines I was at, and the Last Resort is there with Malcolm, Piglet; i say I don’t recognize this footage (I pointedly don’t speak about recognizing any of the people, just the footage itself)</li>
<li>He asks about what I’ve been up to, and why I didn’t mention the time dilation in the mines; I say I just didn’t think to, too much was happening such as me going on so many missions</li>
<li>Larry starts spinning some threads and needles, and when I lie about the Clown being clumsy being why Malakai got away at the Hemlock siege, the needle goes into my arm and it feels numb (Larry doesn’t stop his strange smile, also I failed a roll); I am getting nervous</li>
<li>Jane Doe questions what Morgana was doing in a mansion (she also recognized the footage we saw, I didn’t); she talks about wanting Morgana to cold case herself so show what she was doing at the Last Resort during the time I was captured</li>
<li>Larry asks me if I’m afraid; the needle flies towards me and as I say “yes”, it halts; I say I’m afraid of a lot right now, of the war and the state of everything; Larry says I’m allowed to feel emotions…</li>
<li>Larry tells us vaguely about the time war, the one I wasn’t sure he knew about… now I know</li>
<li>He says some people could destroy everything (he looks at me), such as Chrono-Co; he asks for the identity of SecondHand terrorists</li>
<li>Larry is very scary right now, Jane Doe tries to play good cop to get us to spill, specifically Morgana; she threatened to cause me more harm…</li>
<li>I open up about working with SecondHand just to get the bomb out of me; I don’t know the location but they want Morgana to speak on it; the needle goes into my other arm and it goes numb</li>
<li>I’m told I was supposed to die in the mines, and the reason Larry got me from my timeline to begin with was because they lost <em>their</em> Enigma, and they needed one</li>
<li>He says its possible now for me to live despite my death being planned, and Larry says he’ll kill me if Morgana doesn’t reveal the SecondHand location</li>
<li>Larry asks if Mr. Time, Rosemary, the Clown knows about the Last Resort; Morgana doesn’t know about Mr. Time, is able to lie about Rosemary knowing, but fails to lie about the Clown knowing and my leg gets stabbed, I say Breacher has connections that got us there (alluding to Breacher not being super involved but knowing about it)</li>
<li>I give Morgana a look to say don’t throw Breacher under the bus, but give away Clown works for Hemlock and SecondHand; they know Breacher has involvements but we avoid saying anything outright</li>
<li>Morgana forks up her info on Paradox (her memory footage) instead of the Last Resort coords</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-trial-73-wed">The Trial (7/3 Wed)</h1>
<p>Members: Morgana, Breacher, Marlow, Mr. Time, Rosemary, Simon, Clown, Ringle Tingle (Manav character)</p>
<ul>
<li>Marlow reveals he is keeping his Council seat stagnant as he believes a temporal disruption is behind his seat being available (he’s not giving it up, its sort of a strike); those who know about Clinton don’t take temp damage, the Councilors do though</li>
<li>Me and Morgana are absent from the trial…</li>
<li>Breacher gives her speech, as does Mr. Time, and Larry spurs the conversation about temporal disruptions/fault stabilization</li>
<li>The Eyes Unseen and the Lone Master are present</li>
<li>A team is going to look into the temporal activities (I didn’t catch who)</li>
<li>Zephyr is present and is being pressed on his scientific experiments (the zombie incident); Zephyr says he was able to restore a body pre-death, and asks the Council for funding on his research; Breacher prods for Zephyr to explain the quasi-temporal rudification(?) system (its a re-receptacling of someone’s past mind into their current body; what we learned on our mission); they try to bring the body back temporally (Rachel Anderson rolls her eyes and Breacher sees it)</li>
<li>Breacher unfortunately is pro-punishment for Zephyr, and Mr. Time is against in the name of innovation; (there’s enough no votes so he’s not punished); he’s allowed to continue his research</li>
<li>Next on the docket is traitors; Jane Doe believes Tasha was a SecondHand spy, and wants access to her research and estate; Holly votes in favor but it passes 12-10 that the estate will NOT be investigated, and they will cooperate with Miri instead of seizing the property</li>
<li>Dalton learns Watchers have custody of a Councilor (Tuhorn); he’s suspected SecondHand and the vote is to strip him of his seat and give it to Hannaly or have it be retained; Breacher votes against this and surprisingly so does Mr. Time; the seat is kept on hold for now</li>
<li>Next up is about Damien’s trial; Ringle Tingle McBimbum is his lawyer (he’s a fucking elf who is here because he wants clout); he asks for the charges to be read and Mr. Time reads all of them lmao they were fucking prepared for this rp trial</li>
<li>Tingle hounds Damien for his name being a pun of “D.Trayer” (betrayer) but its Manav being a little shit</li>
<li>Tingle blames Zephyr for Damien being a spy? For some reason??? Damien is being put on trial for the murder of innocents during the Zephyr incident</li>
<li>Tingle tried to jump Breacher for saying he should leave and she’s a hologram so it doesn’t work and he is escorted out</li>
<li>Damien trying to abduct Morgana is brought up, but she’s not here to testify; Rosemary confirms from her hand-trick that he was most likely a Hemlock spy</li>
<li>The Clown defends Damien (MacIntyre says Knights can have him executed) saying that her therapy gave him a change of heart</li>
<li>Morgana and I enter the building; we tell Breacher and Clown that the Watchers know about them and Hemlock/SH</li>
<li>”Derrick” shows up (he looks familiar to all who were there for the Knights siege on Hemlock last friday; most likely the Creel that was there)</li>
<li>Simon hates Damien and testifies that he tried to kill Creel; Morgana testifies on the murder charge, and she says she witnessed Robertson’s murder through a cold case</li>
<li>We warn Clown and she reveals “roasted peanuts” is how she would forget all Hemlock info in an emergency (“crocodile” undoes it)</li>
<li>Breacher knows about me and Morgana being there for the siege but she calls for Damien’s execution; Mr. Time calls for life in prison; Zephyr also calls for some sort of house arrest where he can be observed for genuine change</li>
<li>Orlaith says “they never let us do executions anymore” lmao what a queen</li>
<li>Breacher doesn’t want Damien’s info getting out to everyone, and is trying to get Damien in MacIntyre’s custody (since he’s SH); Breacher advocates for Knights to have custody</li>
<li>Consensus: Damien is in Knights custody, with Chrono-Co being allowed to do tests sometimes</li>
<li>Marlow calls for accountability; a couple people come around Clown and pull her forward; Jane Doe is accusing her of being Hemlock</li>
<li>There’s apparently a dog next to Breacher that only she can see, but now Galloway can… who we remember is Paradox</li>
<li>As Clown gets questioned, David Galloway starts running around and his hands start disintegrating as we see he was made to put on temp handcuffs (Clown put her plan into action); we tell Breacher to keep her cool and say she believes he’s done for when he asks her such; he doesn’t believe her, but he leaves</li>
<li>We tell Breacher to say Clown’s code words and she does, so she can’t be questioned about Galloway (it doesn’t work though?)</li>
<li>Clown admits to knowing Galloway was Hemlock, and was Hemlock herself under threat of him hurting her</li>
<li>MacIntyre pipes up that this Galloway was an imposter who Clown took out so she’s probably not Hemlock (she’ll get a light punishment for admitting to being working with Hemlock but under Galloway’s threats)</li>
<li>Poor Clown has to testify about how Golloway (Paradox) threatened to break her bones and then go back in time to before he broke her bones to break her bones again if she told anyone</li>
<li>Marlow asks about Hemlock agents and Clown says she knows of one who she’s never met and is unsure of (probably Brad…), as well as Damien; she says it was the “big strong one”, Brad for sure, who Jane Doe points out; he’ll be dealt with accordingly (he was later arrested and imprisoned)</li>
<li>Galloway, Damien, Clown, Brad; the 4 Hemlock agents</li>
<li>The Council votes to let Clown be free, and they vote on what to do about her tech; Clown talks about her weapons’ ability to alter memory and such; Breacher really wants to destroy it; Thornwall of the Knights wants to keep it intact, Mr. Time wants it intact for Chrono-Co reasons</li>
<li>Clown’s funny gun and therapy stuff is being brought up as potential weapons for factions… Watchers are against it, Chrono-Co, Breacher against, Knights are on the fence</li>
<li>The Council re-votes on Clown’s status, and Marlow wants her to be under arrest/custody until they are able to understand her tech (its attached to her); then she would be free, and she can work on other projects while under custody</li>
<li>Consensus: Marlow establishes a tri-partheid committee, Clown and her tech are sequestered (joint oversight with Knights and Chrono-Co)</li>
<li>Rachel Anderson is not questioned today; the WatchTower is dedicated to catching Malakai and Paradox, with SH being a side job</li>
<li>Rachel Anderson pipes up about how with all the Council drama, we should go towards automatons; Breacher rips into her about her being full of shit (in respectable terms); Hurlabur (as Sam) hates automatons for reasons he knows not… and he’s against it (on account that they’re communist robots)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
<li>Morgana and I are pulled aside; Larry doesn’t fully believe us but lets us go; he makes the threads loosen so I’m no longer numb, but they’re still in me; he tells us to look into Breacher and the Clown or I’m dead</li>
<li>Larry and Jane Doe say they know far more than us, and we need to know our places and what we need to do; if we disobey, they will harm the both of us; we have 24 hours</li>
<li>My Watch is given back to me… I can tell its bugged but I can’t take it out (its just the GPS type)</li>
<li>Larry tells us not to tell anyone about this…

<h1 id="temporal-faults-dino-park-stealing-from-holly73-wed">Temporal Faults (Dino Park, Stealing From Holly)(7/3 Wed)</h1>
<p>Members: Morgana, Breacher, Marlow, Clown, Nicholas Aurora</p>
<ul>
<li>Zephyr says he can ethically source dinosaurs from a dinosaur park… this sounds familiar but I don’t know why</li>
<li>Jane Doe debriefs us on 3 anomalies in the WatchTower; one is the Knights district, in a haunted house which Trilby Tracker investigated; 2nd is in Dino Park subarea in Chronoland, the Chrono-Co amusement park, it has objects shifted out of time, like a temporal vault or black hole, that’s disrupting gravity and time; 3rd is in CTE which has been shut down, it has been sending people to the wrong places and they sometimes don’t return, if it worsens it can unlock the temporal stability that keeps the WatchTower from being firewalled, SH operatives from the Minutemen district were suspected (cybernetic women “Grasshopper” has been supposedly dealing with these operatives and is currently missing, she’s most likely involved)</li>
<li>Jane Doe mentions my old timeline was wiped in a way similar to what we’re dealing with here… that bitch</li>
<li>I am called to the dino park (something familiar about dinosaurs being brought out of time…)</li>
<li>We see an amusement park and a ticket checker gets Marlow’s badge (he has a loser bronze badge)</li>
<li>We go to dino park and its all dino-themed shit, nothing actually dino-esque; there’s a close off area that leads to tunnel, and Chrono-Co goons stand guard</li>
<li>Tracker tells us the mission; we need to find out the problem (I take 2 temp damage at mention of something I didn’t catch)</li>
<li>Tracker says he’s been looking into these temporal faults and has been getting headaches; he muses over possible angles, and mentions how the vaults destabilizing the WatchTowers means time travel in the WT might be possible?</li>
<li>Tracker also calls Marlow a nark</li>
<li>I Time Sense and see the fault is in the tunnels; we walk through and they are not stable looking, and our footsteps get lighter as we walk through (gravity shift, it was mentioned in the notes)</li>
<li>We see a fork, left is employee’s only with a bloody handprint that disappears as Breacher approaches, she gets temp damage; straight ahead is the fault</li>
<li>Nick opens the door and 3 chrono-co automatons are there saying “error” over and over; I squat by one and run my hand down it… Clown tries to hack it but can only tell its prior objective is now null, something most likely removed from the time stream</li>
<li>I time sense and see a body that doesn’t show up when my TS is off; I say hollowly that there’s a body and everyone else “open their mind” to see it (they take temp damage lmao); Breacher sees a bloodybald man in minuteman attire with a bloody hammer and sword</li>
<li>I also see automatons that aren’t showing up past the TS</li>
<li>Suddenly, gravity switches and we are levitating; I see the body shifting like its standing one moment and then the next slouched, like its glitching between the two states</li>
<li>Breacher looks sad… she can’t tell us anything or we would die</li>
<li>Marlow steadies himself and sees more automatons beyond, as well as a dinosaur sleeping; Nick pats my back at me seeing a dinosaurs</li>
<li>There’s a basketball sized hole, like its been erased and is a black void</li>
<li>In dinosaur park, we recall automaton security and gunfire being exchanged (but I heard from MacIntyre, and he was at the Minutemen districts…); we try to get logs from the bots since they filed reports on what was happening before they went into error mode</li>
<li>Clown makes an insane tech roll and pulls up its video logs, she sees its shooting bullets at nothing; we hit her with a stim and she opens her mind… there’s a shadow on the floor, a minuteman body wielding a hammer and sword fighting with the bots; the bot explodes with purple energy and Clown has a fun thing happen… she’s banished to the LR channel and she tells us she saw someone get handcuffs put on them before disappearing, then they were jumped by chrono-co bots; their life flashed before Clown’s eyes, and they were gunned down (she most likely saw their erasure vs how they were supposed to die)</li>
<li>Someone tells us there was a cyborg lady and there were people with tubes in them; Breacher has to take a call…</li>
<li>We decide to search the Knights districts for the next fault; we need to watch out for the hang lady and to avoid looking at the photos; the TV in the house is playing Moon Detective, and we hear creaking upstairs…</li>
<li>We hear crying in the kitchen, and with my TS I see a lady curled up blipping through time like the minuteman at the dinopark; I squat to get a better look and Marlow looks at the same spot but not opening his mind, so he can see what it looks like normally while I see with my TS eyes</li>
<li>this house has recently definitely been lived in, icecream is out and has been out for days (so days ago was when weird shit happened); the photos are weird, there’s one of stairs, and one of Tasha (there should be people in the pictures)</li>
<li>I feel pulled into somewhere, into an alternate timeline; I don’t resist, and allow myself to be brought in… the woman from the table is there, and I try talking to her; she hears me but can’t see me, and cries about her Tasha being dead, and her getting taken off the Council… I realize its Clinton; I take 11 temp damage, as she shouts don’t go at me and she howls in pain as everything around her disintegrates and she is erased</li>
<li>I am brought back and am convulsing on the ground; Morgana tries to stabilize me (16!); I’m at one hp; I am haunted, and Nick can see the house around him shifting, a child is there and goes “daddy!” while running to their father by the tree; they are a shadow, and as he pats his kid everything disappears</li>
<li>What I saw was the present, what Nick saw was the past; Marlow hears whispering and crying but he refuses to open his mind; he sees a computer about a 9 inch radius 18 inch diameter sphere that’s pulsating; Morgana opens her mind and sees a woman hanging from the ceiling fan, blonde hair and a Knight uniform with a letter in her hand (its Clinton); her note says “dad, I’m sorry. The Council thinks I’m a mess, there’s just nothing left of me here”; I deduce that we’re seeing what her death was supposed to be if she hadn’t gotten erased, like the minuteman at the dino park; I rub my face… Clinton didn’t deserve this</li>
<li>Tracker knows about Clinton, he tells everyone its a former Council seat; he mentions he’s becoming desensitized, and I tell him to be careful, he’s becoming more like me… haha…</li>
<li>I am very depressed lmao</li>
<li>I am looking to touch the orb… Morgana yanks me back. Nick touches the orb and takes 23 temp damage but also saw through it, a woman is punching at air supposedly; she’s punching at something that isn’t there but is supposed to be, before she’s handcuffed and disintegrates; we need to find out who killed her, and we realized Clinton’s killer was also erased</li>
<li>Our last location is the CTE; Barney welcomes us, and I say we’re investigating and he gives us access; the jump point is where the fault is, and none of us are to time jump; its not quite basketball sized, an inch to a centimeter smaller than the fault in the dino park, and quite smaller than in Clinton’s house</li>
<li>Clinton’s incident was the last to happen, as it had the bigger fault (bigger fault = bigger impact or most recent); then dinosaur park, then the CTE</li>
<li>We see a bullet shot, indicating as someone came through the CTE they were shot at; they are tall based on the bullet’s positioning (they’re 7-8 feet tall)</li>
<li>Breacher tells us that what she’s about to discuss cannot be discussed; Tracker and I walk away so we can’t hear, and Nick and Marlow promise, though Breacher gets the sense that three people will know of this info</li>
<li>Breacher calls out to me to get my ass back here as I’m already in the know but I am firm in not hearing this</li>
<li>(I don’t hear this) The fault is def being made by Rachel, as she makes cuffs that can erase people from existence; highly illegal corporate espionage is necessary to get our hands on these cuffs; Breacher knows about AC</li>
<li>Morgana lets Marlow know with his prodding on my behavior that our behavior is something he can asks our Councilors on; he intends to (I go off on a sarcastic rant )</li>
<li>We can get our hands on the handcuffs from Rachel Anderson; Tracker knows about temp handcuffs and brings them up and it takes everyone fucking forever to pick up on this</li>
<li>Only I and Breacher’s drone can see Nick</li>
<li>Clown joins us at this point, and Marlow reveals that Rachel has a target on her back; Marlow is summoned by the Lone Master (we needed an excuse cause Ryan had to leave); he’s on board with the espionage plan and not telling anyone (supposedly)</li>
<li>Breacher’s drone is something that sounds like pansexual that explains how it can detect Nick</li>
<li>6 hours have passed at this point; Morgana is able to get an extension from the 24 hours</li>
<li>Nick gives me earmuffs and I sit and stare into space</li>
<li>Clown tries to hack the Auxiliary Time Engine to get us in an alt timeline so we can get handcuff blueprints</li>
<li>”God’s brightest angel, fallen. Rest in peace rat” - me
“God’s brightest angel is the assassin who tried to kill your friend?!” - Clown
Some time later “God’s brightest angel, fallen. Rest in peace Dingus McQuack” - me</li>
<li>Clown hacks one of the bots after we go to the dino park again and gets info on where to find AC units (lower districts); we’d need to submit forms to Chrono-Co, work for them, or break in; she finds out a bot was given a last command to kill but that person doesn’t exist anymore so the bots are maybe reprogrammable? If they were brought back the bots might activate again</li>
<li>Nick notices my exhaustion and hands me a raisin cookie; I offer to tp inside the building to get us the cuffs (Nick heals me up to full hp at the workshop)</li>
<li>We go to the factory, where the bots are being made; Breacher gets eyes while I am to tp where he tells me; Nick opens the vents and Breacher’s drone goes down; there’s Chrono-Co employees and workshops and engineering type stuff; Rachel Anderson is there, ordering more AC units and wanting an event to present them with</li>
<li>Breacher is able to find an archive with the blueprints; i am given a mask to disguise myself (I almost fully recite my eyes and sword line with Marlow before cutting myself off…)</li>
<li>Clown is given a full Mike meyers getup and me a full Batman costume to sneak in with; I tp me and Clown to the archives (-6 tp)</li>
<li>I fail my agility roll and a bot sees me; Clown plugs her laptop in and starts hacking, I miss a shot at the bot and it thwacks me, -9 hp; Clown needs one more round, and i take a dodge action to keep it on me; I get hit with -15 but am still up (4hp left)</li>
<li>Clown has 4 questions, she finds out the data on the handcuffs that Rachel is working on it in labs down the way, we’re not able to get the specs and I tp me and Clown out (-6, I’m at 6 tp); we got the exact coords on where the cuffs are</li>
<li>Clown stims me for +6 hp (i’m at 10), and I go back in alone to get the cuffs (-2tp); I get two 11s to hide and find the cuffs, 2 automatons spot me and I take -9hp; with my one hp I grab the cuffs and book it the fuck out (-2tp, 1 left)</li>
<li>The bots start swarming and me, Morgana and Clown are in trouble; Paradox speaks to Clown in her head to get us out…</li>
<li>I tp myself out with my last tp so I’m not caught (down the alleys), Morgana and Clown draw distractions and hide; Morgana hits them with the chain lightning but misses, she gets downed</li>
<li>Clown runs the other way and fires her new President’s Gun, and Dwight D. Eisenhower is summoned; he charges at the bots while Clown runs to where I am</li>
<li>Breacher’s drone attaches to Nick and cloaks everyone in darkness, and Nick runs to put a downed Morgana in the workshop (he’s not able to find her from the cloaking)</li>
<li>I keep running, DDE shouts Ike and knocks one of the robots into the air and Clown keeps running</li>
<li>Breacher conjures a wall between the bots and the crew, Nick gets Morgana and we all escape…</li>
<li>DDE is taken down by the bots, and dies (rip to God’s brightest angel)</li>
<li>We meet, me and Clown discard our costumes, and I give the cuffs to Breacher; Clown suddenly is made to roll a Clown check and she understand the cuffs, which shocks through a wearer at every point in every timeline where they die; its excruciatingly painful, and its not so much “erasing” as it is “changing”, you could use an alt timeline and alter the cuffs so they’re temp sent to a pocket dimension</li>
<li>We can possibly bring back erased people…</li>
<li>Me, Breacher, Clown and Morgana stick around, and Clown fills Breacher in on the nature of Paradox and what went down at the trial (everyone knows Paradox is a threat)</li>
<li>Clown made a bot kill David Galloway apparently (the real one possibly)</li>
<li>Actual MC and Monday Is My Off-Day Don’t Text Me are my categories in Sam’s private notes lmao

From the Hemlock mission with Marlow, I can have either: 3 stat points or an ability

<h1 id="out-of-session-1-chronicler">Out of Session 1: Chronicler</h1>
<ul>
<li>The Chronicler releases the weekly obituary. It has a section written by Blorbo about Morgana’s death. It gets promptly altered to a random Knight before too many people can see it. Guess it was a trick of the eyes…</li>
<li>Hairy Harry, the guy we talked to last Sunday, is also dead</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fixing-the-faults-fri-75">Fixing the Faults (Fri, 7/5)</h1>
<p>Members: Morgana, Breacher, Clown/Goblin, Simon, Nicholas Aurora, Rosemary</p>
<ul>
<li>we are doing a time heist to resolve the temporal faults</li>
<li>we can either go back in time and prevent the deaths of the 3 individuals that were deleted, or find who killed them and kill that person</li>
<li>Clown is under house arrest and can&rsquo;t join us, so she sends The Goblin, a minuteman; Breacher knows who this is and hates them</li>
<li>Goblin is dressed like he thinks he&rsquo;s dressed like a convincing ninja (he looks like a green power ranger); he&rsquo;s Russian</li>
<li>Breacher contacts Grasshopper; I walk away so I don&rsquo;t hear this info; they want 500 credits and we have to barter; they can help get a jump point and receptacle</li>
<li>Grasshopper knows Goblin who has apparently done war crimes</li>
<li>Rosemary barters so it&rsquo;s 150 creds</li>
<li>We can Receptacle someone in, someone who needs a pocket watch&hellip; I&rsquo;m the only one (FUCK MY ENTIRE LIFE)</li>
<li>we&rsquo;re getting sent into a timeline that doesn&rsquo;t exist, and is getting created; it will be rapidly decomposing so we have to be in and out quickly</li>
<li>Everyone is made aware of Clinton (I still don&rsquo;t know about AC, though we might meet him)</li>
<li>Smash cut, Clinton, AC; those are our targets</li>
<li>I need to get all three of these into my pocket watch; the jump points are somewhere we should be where a past me isn&rsquo;t and I&rsquo;m able to get them to come with me</li>
<li>We discuss AC, and I get snippets of memory&hellip; me and AC together, a betrayal, and him killing himself&hellip; The feeling of wrongness has been settled, and I remember him. Now I need to meet him once more</li>
<li>Nich says AC was working against Rosemary prior (Manav meta)</li>
<li>Goblin is fast enough to take the handcuffs off AC before he can use them on himself (he has 5 cuffs)</li>
<li>I will be myself, and the others will Receptacled (Marlow has headgear so he can&rsquo;t be used for a Receptacle, but since its a past one it won&rsquo;t work)(I am myself as is Simon, Rose as Mr. Time, Breacher as Marlow, Morgana is Magpie, Dr. Rain is Sidney, Nich will be Damien, Goblin is Goblin)</li>
<li>we need 2 TU to be back and forth; we get one ability from the person we Receptacle (me and Simon get nothing)</li>
<li>We are transported and jump to the moment when AC is downed by automons (when Anderson took him after they attacked me)</li>
<li>We need to use a TU to get AC at this time and maintain the timeline since it was post-him killing Clinton (not mine)</li>
<li>Breacher tries to tp to minuteman districts but fails it and receptacles to a Marlow that is in Watcher HQ trying to take down his elections posters</li>
<li>Nich tries to go into Damien but fails, Goblin succeeds, Simon, Dr. Rain, Rose, Morgana and I were there at this point in time so we&rsquo;re in those rolls inherently (I see my past self with AC, along with the others; Simon is in his past self); we&rsquo;re at the moment AC is talking to me in the warehouse</li>
<li>Automots are storming and past Breacher is going off like she did back then; i take -9 temp at being around my alt self (which i have to double cause I have time vulnerability cause SAM HATES ME)</li>
<li>alt Enigma opens a portal to get everyone out; the past selves run out, and AC gets downed by the bots</li>
<li>Dr. Rain sees AC get tp&rsquo;d, and his eyes flick open before he is; it was a false assassination and kidnapping</li>
<li>Dr. Rain taps me and Goblin so time freezes for everyone but us, Dr. Rain runs up to AC to knock him out with a baseball bat but he&rsquo;s still up; Goblin knocks him out, and Morgana (Magpie) runs so the automotons, Goblin gets downed from 25 damage goddamn and goes fucking brain dead</li>
<li>I do a tech check and remove AC&rsquo;s straight up fucking hands so he doesn&rsquo;t have his cuffs; I put him in my pocket watch for -1 TU</li>
<li>I take -6 temp WHICH IS 12 SO IM DOWNED AGAIN</li>
<li>The goblins (Goblin&rsquo;s goblins) try stabilizing me and both fucking fail; I&rsquo;m stabilized by Morgana after being almost killed (it would&rsquo;ve been the dumbest fucking death, we had to use advantage)</li>
<li>Grasshopper says I&rsquo;m from another timeline. Thanks. The reason I was able go be in my own body and didn&rsquo;t get receptacled is because I&rsquo;m an anomoly</li>
<li>We teleport to the place with Clinton and SmashCut (-1 TU); we blip after Tasha&rsquo;s murder when Clinton was alone in her house</li>
<li>Breacher R&rsquo;s into Goblin</li>
<li>Simon stims me so I&rsquo;m at 26hp</li>
<li>Clinton is asleep and Moon Detective plays</li>
<li>I mercilessly kill one of Goblin&rsquo;s goblins and gain a TU with Damien&rsquo;s sword that gives a TU when you kill an innocent (I did over kill on the first, this is brutal)</li>
<li>I failed rolls to kill it so I take -16 (8 doubled); I get heals and am at 22</li>
<li>Rosemary as Mr. Time tries waking her up and gets punched cause why the fuck is Mr. Time in Clinton&rsquo;s house</li>
<li>Rose as Mr. Time says &ldquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time that I told you you&rsquo;re in danger!&rdquo; With a creepy smile because she keeps doing this for some reason</li>
<li>Clinton stabs Mr. Time and runs out; Dr. Rain calms her down a bit and upon seeing me and Simon; Watchers are coming…</li>
<li>Nich is played by Manav who is the dumbest motherfucker and grabs Damien&rsquo;s sword for some reason to calm down</li>
<li>Dr. Rain is able to calm her down enough so we&rsquo;re out of to back away from the Watchers</li>
<li>Nich as Damien talks to Clinton and says we need to take her away for a mission; he fails and she starts running down the alley</li>
<li>Morgana and Dr. Rain run past her and try to calm her; she is surrounded and realizes she cannot escape</li>
<li>we talk to her and say that the timeline is unstable and we need her to come with us; I tell her the truth that Tasha isn&rsquo;t alive and we get her in my watch (-1 TU)</li>
<li>We take -6 temp for some reason (-12 for me)</li>
<li>Alek comes through to us by Grasshopper and says people are looking for Breacher (a lady with a stick and a cyber lady); Morgan knows stick lady is Jane Doe</li>
<li>We go to Smashcut, Morgana and Breacher bargains with Alek Wilde for stuff as Magpie and Goblin (Breacher&rsquo;s trying not to reveal too much)</li>
<li>Morgana as Magpie isn&rsquo;t able to get out of this and gets arrested by Alek (she&rsquo;ll be fine)</li>
<li>Breacher communicates with another person, her past self; they are arguing with each other (old Breacher isn&rsquo;t hiding it)</li>
<li>I take -12 tp again -Rosemary, Simon and Nich blip back (Nila had to leave)</li>
<li>Alek and Grasshopper are holding Magpie (Morgana); all of a sudden Jett walks in (THE REAL ONE)(the convo with the minutemen is one in not here for); Madame E is in a pod that Alek tells him not to worry about, Jett needs to get in the pod</li>
<li>Jett does some sus shit</li>
<li>Dr. Rain found Smartwatch or whatever; we gotta convince him to get in the watch; they threaten him a bit and he grabs for a sickle and hammer; we hear a &ldquo;dad&rdquo; and Smash mouth tells the kid to stay back while dealing with us</li>
<li>Dr. Rain gaslights Smartphone but it doesn&rsquo;t work; Breacher grabs the kid and puts a gun to their head and threatens to kill them</li>
<li>Breacher (as goblin) calls out his bs and we threaten again; he steps into my stopwatch (-TU); the kid screams at us and punches at Breacher (it doesn&rsquo;t do anything)</li>
<li>we leave (-TU)</li>
<li>I can&rsquo;t hear but Breacher is talking to Grasshopper and Alek about what to do with our people; we need to reinegrate our people into the timeline</li>
<li>we head to Jett&rsquo;s; we talk about the Goblin I fucking killed</li>
<li>Jett talks about Queens; we get to his place, it&rsquo;s small and quaint, fitting for an alcohol whose wife died</li>
<li>Alek talks us through what to do here; he&rsquo;s working on the device that would send the people back, handcuffs are on them so they&rsquo;re reintegrated in a way that it will do a reverse of what cuffs usually do</li>
<li>We pull out Clinton first, she&rsquo;s a little shocked and has a bruise on her wrist</li>
<li>She says an &ldquo;evil version of her assistant was there&rdquo; and smashcut hit him with a hammer</li>
<li>we tell her to trust us on putting handcuffs; a purple energy courses through her and she disintegrates before she reappears</li>
<li>Breacher asks her what she remembers and she last remembers is being at home with AC</li>
<li>AC is pulled out; he&rsquo;s unconscious and we remove his cuffs, while putting on the new cuffs (it works)</li>
<li>We have to kill him as he should be dead, and Enigma says she&rsquo;ll do it; he comes to and greets me; my hands are shaking</li>
<li>He asks what happened, he last remembers being in the warehouse with me</li>
<li>It goes against his programming, and he glitches and takes energy damage, and tells me he&rsquo;s a spy&hellip; I say I know, I forgive him, and I shoot him</li>
<li>We get Smashcut out shouting for Goblin and barely misses me with his hammer; he learns Goblin is dead</li>
<li>Morgana quickly handcuffs him and he&rsquo;s back as the past version</li>
<li>Morgana says she hears footsteps and we need to leave</li>
<li>Jett opens his back door and Marlow is there; he is here to arrest Alek Wilde</li>
<li>Marlow is here to catch a Receptacle kingpin; Breacher chews him out for interfering with our mission</li>
<li>Jane Doe is here as well; Marlow mentions he attacked Grasshopper earlier</li>
<li>Breacher tries defending Alek, she doesn&rsquo;t care about the den when he helped us save the timeline</li>
<li>I reason with Jane Doe that this was part of our mission and I would have reported anything anyway (I&rsquo;m telling the truth, I&rsquo;m forced to); I get a NAT12 on character and she believes me l, and says I can go (as well as everyone else)</li>
<li>As I speak, Breacher does a sneaky and I prepare to protect people; Alek is rushing through the back door Marlow chases, Breacher plans to back up Alek but right as she is about to move Smashcut wallops Marlow and hits him critically</li>
<li>Jane Doe attacks Smashcut; Breacher runs up to Wilde; Marlow put normal handcuffs on Wilde, Jett says &ldquo;get off my boss&rdquo; and attacks Marlow</li>
<li>Jett downs Marlow and tells Alek to run</li>
<li>Nich turns invisible and watches everything; Simon fucking leaves</li>
<li>Watchers outside shot at Smashcut when he didn&rsquo;t freeze and he&rsquo;s shot in an alley; just as seen in his vision…</li>
<li>Simon took Clinton with him to MacIntyre so she&rsquo;s safe</li>
<li>Me and Morgana are giving chase, we aren&rsquo;t stopping Jane Doe but we don&rsquo;t plan to let her kill Breacher (or Jett if we can help it)</li>
<li>Watchers surround Breacher and stim Marlow; Alek is running down the hull, and gets restrained by Marlow&hellip; they&rsquo;re taken off call</li>
<li>We hear gunshots and tasing noises, as well as Jett shouting; Jett was tasered and stunned while Alek was restrained</li>
<li>Marlow&rsquo;s watch says Minutemen are coming in</li>
<li>Breacher&rsquo;s safe from a distance, watching through a drone; I stand over Jett, and insist we should be careful and not cause a conflict with the Minutemen</li>
<li>Alek has been apprehended, but Breacher allows it (seems like they have a plan&hellip;)</li>
<li>I keep Jett stable and me and Marlow agree he should be let free so we don&rsquo;t mess with the Minutemen anymore; I take Jett up, there&rsquo;s a riot happening but no shots aren&rsquo;t being fired</li>
<li>Alek talks to Breacher before he&rsquo;s detained, and she tries to convince him to do something so the riots don&rsquo;t get worse</li>
<li>Marlow let&rsquo;s him record a message telling the minutemen to stand down</li>
<li>Jane says Alek won&rsquo;t qualify for a plea deal, and though he won&rsquo;t get capital punishment, he&rsquo;ll probably get life in prison&hellip; it&rsquo;s up to the Council</li>
<li>Breacher chews out Jane Doe on knowing what she is and what she wants
Mission&hellip; Success</li>
<li>Manav, Jandro and me imagine a scenario where inside my watch I go to get our people and AC has a Disco ball on his head and bubble gun hands with his eyes doing strobe lights as Clinton and Smartcar dance; a t-rex is doing the shuffle in the background</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="chrono-co-vs-paradox-sun-77">Chrono-Co vs Paradox (Sun, 7/7)</h1>
<p>I KNOW NON OF THIS CANONICALLY THESE ARE JUST MY NOTES TO LOOK BACK ON
Members: Rosemary, Mr. Time, Clown (Viv and I were here for fun)</p>
<ul>
<li>I join late into a session I wasn’t supposed to be at (not canonically, me as player was here for fun)</li>
<li>Clown, Rosemary, and Mr. Time fight Paradox to save Mr. Time’s mom (Morgana wasn’t here either? But Vivien was? And then Morgana was? idfk)</li>
<li>Rosemary is in love with Cecilia Dalton apparently</li>
<li>Mr. Time killed a child apparently; he’s also having an identity crisis over everything being a lie. Same.</li>
<li>Also there’s cameras cause of course Mr. Time has cameras watching</li>
<li>One of the Parodi turns into a genie? And goes into Mr. Time’s head??? He’s in the 80s riding a bike down the street, he falls and skims his knee; a figure says “its ok John!” and helps him up; he has icecream later and talks to his mother about school; fast forward and he’s older, he’s a carpenter working before a portal open up and Mr. Time flashes back to the present</li>
<li>Mr. Time loses his trademark smile</li>
<li>Paradox taunts Rosemary but she’s able to shoot him successfully despite probably not knowing about his abilities and just being really confident and desperate (she also admits to killing people before on live TV lmao)</li>
<li>Mother Time tells “John” they need to get out of here, he responds out of reflex</li>
<li>Mr. Time takes his mother and shoots at the second Paradox; he’s still in Mr. Time’s head, and is telling him he can “show him the world”&hellip; Clown tries to get Mr. Time to cast him out</li>
<li>Paradox promises to let Rosemary see an alt future where she Cecilia falls in love with her; Rosemary resists and is shown visions by Paradox of her and Cecilia’s wedding, and in this montage suddenly a little gnome pops out of the wedding cake and shoots her; Rosemary is sent back to the present, she rewinds so she doesn’t take mental damage</li>
<li>Mr. Time wants more memories, and lets Paradox in a little more so he can remember; his memories go as far back as Crono-Co putting him in his current body, but with this opportunity he sees himself in a strapped chair confused after having signed something…</li>
<li>Mr. Time gives him too much power, and everyone gets transported to a clown funhouse; Mr. Time’s mom is decaying in the background</li>
<li>Two Cecilia Daltons call for Rosemary, who says the real Cecilia would before their voices distort and call for her in a cursed voice; they turn into ravens with Cecilia’s face, and Rosemary takes them down</li>
<li>Paradox says Rose isn’t fun anymore, and tells her she can leave… she refuses to go without her friends. She tries shooting him but her bullets turn into water</li>
<li>Clown isn’t able to completely get Paradox out of Mr. Time’s head, but she’s able to control the dreamscape a bit (one Paradox is by Mr. Time, one’s my Rosemary)</li>
<li>An anvil, which was always there and def not conjured by Clown, falls on Paradox’s leg</li>
<li>Rosemary tries doing corporate talk and legal jargon to intimidate Paradox; he pops his leg off that was under the anvil, turns it into a gatling gun and shoots at her with his disembodied leg; she gets downed, and Clown has to stim her</li>
<li>Rosemary forms a bomb in Paradox that finally goes off, exploding the mf; one Paradox are down, and the office space starts to turn back to its form</li>
<li>the remaining Paradox talks to Mr. Time before leaving…; in an attempt to stop him, Mr. Time imagine him working in the Chrono-Co mines; the clownhouse starts turning into these mines</li>
<li>Clown’s friendship chains drag Paradox into the mines of Mr. Time’s head, and he is effectively trapped in Mr. Time for eternity</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="medieval-town-watcher-sun-77">Medieval Town; Watcher (Sun, 7/7)</h1>
<p>Members: Morgana, Magpie, Rosemary, Izzy, Dr. Rain</p>
<ul>
<li>Magpie learns her Councilor Alek Wilde was arrested</li>
<li>Clown has no more makeup… she also has a new gun,and her house arrest has been suspended for this mission (approved by Dalton); she is Izzy now</li>
<li>The cameraman from the mission is still in Mr. Time’s head lmao</li>
<li>We won’t be able to find Selene today (was planned but Nikita wasn’t here), so we follow other leads; we have anti-apocalypse shit, alt timeline where Holly’s engineer is, looking into Anderson or Jane Doe or other shit, etc</li>
<li>Morgana tells the group about my new predicament, that I have another bomb situation; Rosemary and Clown are worried, and I push Rosemary’s very close face away while telling everyone I’ll be fine and won’t die, we just need to complete the mission (Morgana is annoyingly persistent in wanting to save me and won’t let it go; Rosemary suggests we do the missions and focus on me later since I’m clearly not willing right now)</li>
<li>we’re going for Holland’s engineer; Grasshopper and Alek Wilde getting arrested</li>
<li>We decide to check out Holly’s engineer, and we go to Miri’s mansion and Clown creates a drop point; we don’t know when or where we are, but we are at the coords for the private Chrono-Co engineer spa (-2 TU); Rosemary only had 2 TU so she’ll have to stay here overnight</li>
<li>Dr. Rain joined!</li>
<li>We get Rosemary’s list of engineers, and start the tracking (objectives: Find Selene, find timeline stability tech)</li>
<li>We arrive at a Majavi desert-type desert, there’s some old, almost medieval looking houses around; this isn’t apocalyptic, just small community I think</li>
<li>There’s a town square and people are going about; we don’t know if these are engineers, they look like normal people and there’s a farm</li>
<li>I Time Sense and see a faint purplish glow within the dirt (14 roll baby; its not traceable, but the dirt could be sampled or dug up)</li>
<li>We see weird looking cows, as well as the main town square having a temple, general stores and such, and a mound where bodies are being piled up</li>
<li>Magpie invisible slips into the tailor shop to get us era-appropriate clothes; the tailor talks with a customer about the castle being open for visitation now as part of something the Mayor’s doing; Magpie invisibly goes to the back</li>
<li>Rosemary suggests murder and mugging on two separate occasions; I mutter “what is up with you today”</li>
<li>Dr. Rain is receptacle’d, and in his peasant disguise he finds tailoring outfits for us would take too long; Clown uses TU to go back to the Tower to get us era-appropriate clothes</li>
<li>Dr. Rain shoves Morgana in front of the tailor to ask if her outfit is weird; this was a brilliant segway into him asking if anyone else in this clothing has passed by… he mentions strange characters in town, some devil worshippers</li>
<li>We dress up and go to the mound; bodies are being piled and the people putting them there are singing a tune… &ldquo;Pile high, pile high, the devil&rsquo;s underground. Pile high, pile high, keep the devil down.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Rosemary uses her catholic detection abilities to tell that the church is quite catholic</li>
<li>the church person tells her they dealt with their “demon issues”; they say the devil was in this town, and they had to defeat him; they say it was a new church of devil worshippers had rolled into town and Rosemary plays up being very catholic (6 months ago is when they “vanquished the devil”; Chrono-Co came about 2 weeks ago)</li>
<li>This is an alt timeline so they never had the Romans lmao</li>
<li>We are in the time of Amity; they elected a mayor that served a one month term, but its collective meeting with the town that really decide things</li>
<li>Morgana goes up to the cow and sees it has three eyes; they look mutated in some way, one cow has an extra leg, it seems their mutations are intentional; the other animals are mutated too</li>
<li>The wheat is a bit decayed but edible; plants are a little bit gnarled but nothing weird; my time sense doesn’t pick up anything, its all within time</li>
<li>Magpie steals a shovel; they observe the bodies on the mound and find they’re also a bit mutated; time sense doesn’t pick up anything; I observe some of the townspeople have a bit of mutation but nothing too much, and the people in the mound seems to have died not from murder but from the mutation</li>
<li>Clown says the bodies are the results of radiation poisoning, and nuclear waste/a reactor is probably present</li>
<li>There are not many young people in this town, and there are babies in the mound (young people are more susceptible to disease)</li>
<li>Castle time; we see a few folks outside talking; the castle door is guarded by two armored peasants (they’re not knights, this is a small town); as we walk up the guards recognize “Jake” (receptacle Dr. Rain is in), and we are allowed in (we are said to be friends of Jake and the mayor would like to talk to us to do a check up, standard stuff for outsiders)</li>
<li>Inside we see a humble throne with a women sitting atop; there’s 5 chairs around her, and “Jake” introduces us; she says this town is wary of outsiders so they need to make sure we’re cool</li>
<li>The mayor says they have ways of detecting demons ; Clown observes their demon detecting tech and thinks back to Chrono-Co tech school, where she learned about a device that detects watches that have bombs, identifies people, sees if they’re in a receptacle, etc</li>
<li>Dr. Rain jumps into action and stalls time for 15 seconds, breaking the scanner a bit so it doesn’t detect our watches; I sense the scanner the mayor has and its definitely out of time</li>
<li>They are suspicious of us based on the reading, and Rosemary says we’re from the same town; they ask for Clown to point out where London is (that’s where Rose said we were from) and fails but Dr. Rain rewinds time; Morgana was pulled aside for a second but Dr. Rain rewinded time so she doesn’t remember</li>
<li>Clown lies about being an alchemist apprentice who was sent here at mention of demons; she is impressed by the demon detector (which the mayor and her people don’t understand cause its tech they got somehow) and Clown fixes it for them; she is able to properly point out London on a map this time (they ask “when”&hellip;)</li>
<li>Clown’s fix makes it so we are undetected; the mayor says she’s seen demons; she says they look just like us, and she says they promised infinite (this is a weird thing for someone in this time period to say); she says it is false promises, and the “blight” (poisoning) is their work, but they have been trapped down and the town is safe because of it</li>
<li>I ask what demons look like, and she says they look like people but the wand (detector) tells us who is a demon; she says those brave enough to fight took the wand from the demon, and that’s how they got it</li>
<li>This town used to have monarchs but they were not needed anymore; Rosemary gets out of them that the “powers” the demons have been seen to have is using “implements” (watches) and without those these demons are powerless</li>
<li>I ask how they know the doors are secure enough, and they say the Dig Well is how the evil is kept hidden</li>
<li>the last outsider to ask about the door was a demon, 3 months ago or so one came</li>
<li>Rosemary talks about a demon with purple hair that she saw once (Selene), and the mayor confirms that they had someone a month ago or so with purple hair ask to open the Dig Well and disappear into place where the “evil” is; she was alone when she entered</li>
<li>The “Dig Well” is off limits and must be remain closed, so we’ll have to be sneaky</li>
<li>The mayor offers us to be at the sausage festival and says they’re a big producer of sausage casings, Rosemary is excited and I have to politely decline on account of she clearly forgot the food is poisoned with radiation</li>
<li>We were told prior that the Chrono-Co engineers were told they would be in charge of this timeline, and clearly it didn’t work as they were killed by the people of this town</li>
<li>We head back to HQ to replenish everything and get to the exact point in time in this alt timeline to when Selene came in</li>
<li>Morgana sees her watch has several unread messages, mostly from Jane Doe, and apparently 5 days have passed (fuck fuck SHIT); we have about one week until doomsday now</li>
<li>Me and Morgana are being summoned by our Councilors, same with Rosemary, Clown was supposed to be on house arrest (she calls Zephyr and apparently he thought she died so he built a fake Clown so the Watchers wouldn’t know lmao)</li>
<li>We meet with Larry and Jane, and we explain we were in an alt timeline that dilated us a few days; Larry muses this but I don’t know why</li>
<li>Morgana is told to follow Jane Doe privately, and Morgana demands my threads are taken out first; Larry says “oops” and numbs me entirely, and is forced to follow Jane Doe…</li>
<li>Larry and I are alone, and we talk; he says we were fed propaganda, but</li>
<li>His Enigma was sent to my timeline, and there was a mistake so they ended up taking me; the original was most likely destroyed, and she was supposed to die in the mines which would start something between Holly and the Watchers… I learn the start of the war is something that can change, but the war will always have started and I play a significantly bigger part</li>
<li>I ask why he didn’t tell me about the apocalypse, and he says he wasn’t sure if he could trust me since I wasn’t the og Enigma; he confirms armageddon, and says it must happen even if stability tech can be found because if we can just stabilize timelines, people can just kill who they want or fuck around with what they want whenever they want and just erase the problem</li>
<li>If we continue with armageddon, our timeline will be fucked but existence will continue; its about the greater good</li>
<li>I understand… and I submit to the Watchers</li>
<li>Morgana is promised to be unharmed (thankfully they see her as “misguided” and being sold propaganda by Second Hand), but something happened to Breacher that “I will see”&hellip; her safety cannot be guaranteed, and Larry says she will die (either now or from armageddon, it doesn’t matter)</li>
<li>I won’t jeopardize anyone’s safety, but I will admit to everything that won’t get someone killed or compromised if they haven’t been found out already</li>
<li>I use one my two Watcher-given upgrades to bring Character to +3</li>
<li>Clown leaves for house arrest (Nate had to go, so did Dr. Rain)
~~~~~~~~~</li>
<li>Morgana and I talk after being let go, I’m staring at the sunset and she approaches me asking if I’m ok… I don’t respond</li>
<li>I ask her what she plans to do with a hard stare, she avoid the question and says lets go out for ice cream with the Knights. I don’t follow, and she stops</li>
<li>I tell her she was assured to not be harmed, but by defecting, all bets are off, and Breacher is already facing her fate</li>
<li>I am truthful, my threads were taken out and I am sticking with Larry and the Watchers by choice</li>
<li>i tell her to leave, that this is her one chance to, and then we are enemies</li>
<li>She tells me to tell Jane Doe “its been a pleasure” (she means it), and to tell Larry to go fuck himself</li>
<li>She holds back tears and says she’ll miss me, and “try not to die”&hellip; my back is turned to her as she says it, and my back is turned to her as I walk away.
End of Session
OBJECTIVE: Stop the Second Hand, destroy Hemlock</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="private-debrief-with-larry-mon-78">Private Debrief With Larry (Mon, 7/8)</h1>
<ul>
<li>I reveal to Larry that I saw some version of Tuhorn at the Last Resort, and that Holly Holland uses time dilation tech (I am told by Sam I was a strange hire for Chrono-Co, most of the miners were from that timeline and had been indoctrinated into a cult orchestrated by Chrono-Co to get them to want to work)</li>
<li>He knows Breacher was working with Second Hand to remove my bomb, and knows she’s sus</li>
<li>I relay what Morgana told me to tell Jane Doe and Larry Morton (Larry jokes that he wants to rip out her entrails; he assures me he’s joking upon seeing how nervous I am at the comment)</li>
<li>They say Nich may have been in communication with Breacher, so he’s being a bit monitored to find out where she is</li>
<li>Alek was pursued with an operative to ensure he was killed, but Marlow accidentally ruined that; Watchers don’t want him attending a trial or he’ll spill everything, he’ll need to be transferred to Chono-Co and I will assassinate him and frame Chono-Co</li>
<li>Larry says the Minutemen are in turmoil because of Wilde’s arrest; they’re pulling strings to get Jett angry enough that I can blip him to Alek and he’ll kill the guy and take care of the body</li>
<li>He says they had to use their “communal paycheck” to convince Grasshopper to work for us</li>
<li>He says this timeline won’t end, at a point in time the world will; the WatchTower is growing too big, so they want to downsize so its just a small group of Watchers who survive the fallout of the war to keep the peace (the Hemlock base we took over will be our new HQ); I have been invited</li>
<li>Larry says Morgana can be spared, I just must make sure she doesn’t become a problem</li>
<li>There is supposedly a Knight Councilor who is with Second Hand, and I lie (successfully!) about not knowing any Knight Councilors; MacIntyre’s safe, and Marlow will look into it</li>
<li>The Council is integral to the plan, some things shouldn’t have happened and shit got messed up that led to new elections and such; Watchers didn’t want Tuhorn’s seat getting taken because it won’t go to Chrono-Co</li>
<li>Me testifying will pin the blame on Holly Holland, which will set the plan in motion</li>
<li>ooc Wilde and Breacher are targets, so I can go on the Breacher kill squad (it won’t actually kill her cause she has prep time)</li>
<li>Watcher endgame: Holly is the spark, which isn’t actually her death but her being backed into a corner and being declared an enemy by the Watchers (the “new Hemlock”), they have the evidence and will sick the Knights on them; this will escalate into an interior WatchTower war that I don’t know the details of yet… the war will be Watchers vs Chrono-Co (and I need to get my “masquerade ball clothes” ready)</li>
<li>Holly is British apparently; she hates the poors, and her death is more of a statement than necessary (its her reputation ending that causes the spark)
End of Talk
OBJECTIVE: Prepare for the trial; Assassinate Alek Wilde; Get an AC unit gun from Dr. Zephyr, get to Dr. Rain’s lab and observe the chronite
(Upcoming: Find the stability tech, trap Holly in my pocket watch and give her to LRS [tell them about Grasshopper’s betrayal and to evacuate])</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="out-of-session-2-going-over-notes-non-canonically">Out of Session 2: Going Over Notes (non-canonically)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Out of session, I canonically found Simon doing his conspiracy board in my room in the Knights’ barracks, and I told him to fuck off but didn’t actually make him; he did his board while I filled out field reports</li>
<li>Sam told me they stopped a rift in space time during the Greece mission; the Battle of Salamis was changed and they needed to correct it, the Greeks were supposed to win with Themistocles but in this version he wasn’t around; Themistocles was supposed to be in charge of the Athenians</li>
<li>In Egypt Breacher was receptacle’d into a cat; they were recovering heisted materials</li>
<li>In the London session, funny gun put some people’s minds in others; Che Guevara was there</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-testimonial-assault-on-breacher-compound-wed-710">The Testimonial, Assault on Breacher Compound (Wed, 7/10)</h1>
<p>Members: Marlow, Breacher, Jett, Clown, Mr. Time, Phantom (Anu), Nicholas/Eyes Unseen, Jungwon Moon</p>
<ul>
<li>A council meeting is called, and Dalton marks it starting at 5:17pm</li>
<li>Mr. Time’s anti-terrorism mission is brought up, and he mentions his mech suit came in handy against Hemlock terrorists; he says he took down Paradox by trapping him in Mr. Time’s mind; Lone Master questions how we know Mr. Time is mentally capable of holding Paradox at bay (he plugs the mech suit and Chrono-Co therapy)</li>
<li>Orlaith questions more, and Tracker confirms with Widgeon Giles that they saw it go down (this may not be true… they might’ve been payed off?)</li>
<li>Marlow brings up a method that can secure Paradox even more in Mr. Time, a locking device with regard to Receptacles; Mr. Time puts it on</li>
<li>Next item, temporal faults: Marlow, Breacher and Mr. Time were part of this mission</li>
<li>Breacher says there are devices that can erase people from existence, handcuffs (she presents them and schematics); she hard accuses Rachel Anderson of being behind it, saying she has all sorts of proof; Anderson mentions she has worked on disintegration cuffs, but not these temporal cuffs (she says its more likely Minutemen work); Breacher admits to out illegal work in taking the three faults and returning them to our timeline (the mission I was there for)</li>
<li>Jane Doe hounds on Breacher for not consulting the Council; she calls for a vote on punishing Breacher for this</li>
<li>Marlow votes yes to approve Breacher’s actions, but he raises caution on allowing such things like this to slip leaving way for Alek Wilde to do shit; everyone votes yes accept Rachel and Thornwald, who don’t like Breacher</li>
<li>Breacher says she went through getting permissions to analyze the schematics, backing Rachel into a corner; she counters that Breacher broke into her facility to get the cuffs but she’s clearly grasping at straws (she name drops me being there lmao)</li>
<li>Breacher calls Rachel out for being behind the assassination attempt on Breacher, and for hiring Smashcut</li>
<li>Jane votes to convict Rachel Anserson, and has her face criminal charges; Knights and Watchers are so down to convict lmao (the one thing we can agree on… Enigma feels something seeing us all come together); Chrono-Co is split, Mr. Time wants to expel her from the Chrono-Co family; Rachel is allowed to vote cause everything’s corrupt</li>
<li>Lightborn, Holland, Hannaly, and Anderson vote on behalf of Chrono-Co, and Anderson is expelled from the Council</li>
<li>Dalton (or Dustin?) says Anderson apparently had a contingency to kill all the other Chrono-Co… there was a whole fight within Chrono-Co lmao he just didn’t mention it until now</li>
<li>Rachel screams and curses at Breacher, swearing out the Minutemen and promising she’ll return</li>
<li>Councilor Orlaith has charges against Clinton, and wants her removed from the Council on account of her absence; she also says a Rachel Anderson spy killed Clinton, making Clinton incompetent (she also brings up Clinton “sleeping” with Tasha, a known SecondHand spy), and exposing her to Second Hand</li>
<li>Breacher votes to keep her, Mr. Time votes to expel, Chrono-Cos and Watchers are generally in favor but its not enough, Clinton keeps her job, though she is no longer on the Security Committee (MacIntyre’s got it covered)</li>
<li>Tuhorn and Galloway are not in attendance… that’s next up</li>
<li>No one knows what the fuck happened to Galloway lmao</li>
<li>Larry Morton comes up and says Tuhorn is a terrorist with Second Hand; Tuhorn is walked out; Marlow isn’t happy about this but he testifies against Tuhorn, saying he sent encrypted messages to “The Guy”, who was part of Tasha Tennyson’s book club</li>
<li>I give away that Tuhorn was at Last Resort and Spa, and i give away that Morgana and Breacher was there; Breacher defends herself that she was there following leads (Larry lets it go, but he has a glint in his eye that tells he’s planning something)</li>
<li>Tuhorn says he won’t confess to a kangaroo court (he speaks in rhymes, and he seems calm); everyone voted to convict him, it was unanimous (apparently Tuhorn is uncle benny? I don’t fucking know who that is)</li>
<li>We have two more topics; Alek Wilde who is Watcher custody is being discussed to be transferred to Chrono-Co; Marlow is highly against this, he clearly doesn’t know about the plan (Larry didn’t tell him); he has a badass moment where he’s cut off mid-speech and goes “I am speaking Councilor” THAT’S MY BOY</li>
<li>Grasshopper is brought up as having spilled some shit</li>
<li>Wilde’s illegal Receptacle den is brought up, and Marlow alleges many crimes happen under the Watch Tower</li>
<li>Mr. Time gives a speech on why Chrono-Co should have custody; people on the fence are swayed, and Marlow is clearly not happy but there’s nothing he can do</li>
<li>Jett jumps in and says the Minutemen should have Alek; the Council laughs because the Minutemen aren’t a respected faction; Enigma glares</li>
<li>One last thing on the docket, accusations against Holly; Jane Doe summons me to testify; I confirm I was forced to go into these time-dilated mines, and I believe these operations included sending people through unregulated jump points… to alternate timelines. Where I was sent. The crowd is surprised</li>
<li>I testify my truth; I was made to sign an NDA, and Holly under Dalton’s nose forced a bomb in me; I hate that I have to testify this</li>
<li>Holly asks to say her piece, and Jett shouts “everyone take cover” cause he has bomb trauma or something; Holly tells everyone to calm down, and says if they do anything to her we all will explode; she presses her watch and teleports out</li>
<li>Marlow attempted to counter-spell and it fails, she has tech that can counter; Holly is convicted</li>
<li>Meeting Adjourned
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
<li>Jungwon Moon arrives!</li>
<li>We receive word that an individual is suspected of being Second Hand; we meet a new character, the Phantom of the Disco (Anu, since Damien is in custody)</li>
<li>Breacher is the suspect, the Watchers are assembling a force; me, Izzy, Jett, Jungwon, Mr. Time and Phantom</li>
<li>I am asked by Jane Doe to elaborate on Breacher; Larry stares down my neck… I explain that Breacher took me to LRS to remove my bomb, but she continued to collude with Second Hand even after that
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Members: Breacher, Marlow, Jett, Clown, Mr. Time, Phantom (Anu), Nicholas/Eyes Unseen, Jungwon Moon</li>
<li>We remeet and are told by Jane Doe Breacher has admitted to being Second Hand, and we are assembling a squad to kill her (i ask if we can apprehend, and Larry says if I can I can, but I can aim to kill)</li>
<li>Robo-Clown (I’m calling her that) questions why Breacher’s status as Second Hand wasn’t brought up in the trial, but was dropped and now we’re supposed to assassinate Breacher; she’s not wrong…</li>
<li>Jungwon was sent by her handler is very confused; Mr. Time fills her in (I glare at him when he says Breacher as his political ally is someone he doesn’t mind killing)</li>
<li>I finally lose my cool and question why Clown is being weird; her and Mr. Time go to talk in private… when they come back, Mr. Time assures me she just has a cold (my eye twitches); I need to lean up against the wall and think, Clown jokes about “losing my head” and I glare at her with purple eyes…</li>
<li>Phantom goes on about being from Burning Man and he has an arsenal of drugs; Jungwon smokes some (she a brief moment she gets sent to a disco dimension)</li>
<li>Clown says I should lead the charge, as my Councilor is in charge</li>
<li>Breacher’s compound: first floor has offices, second floor has drones and tech, third floor is unknown</li>
<li>As we approach, Marlow is there (NPC, Ryan had to leave), he has a squad with HGTF, and we are to look out for invisibility drones</li>
<li>Clown says I should stay behind and dance with Phantom to cool down, I say I should lead and she should follow</li>
<li>Jane asks me if I know where Breacher is, and I say I don’t know; Jane is attacking from the first floor (she kills a goon) and tells me to tp with Jett; I’m going to the second floor with him</li>
<li>Jungwon tries to locate Breacher in the 2nd floor but a trap is triggered and black covers the room, as well as smoke; she warns Jane Doe of this</li>
<li>Mr. Time gets in his mech suit and fights the terrorists with his typical cool guy taking down terrorists attitude</li>
<li>Jungwon gave me second floor layout, I take Jett and Marlow to the third floor (-3 charges), right in front of the door and passed the gas (the stairwell); Marlow tries lock picking the door leading to the third room, and he decides to use explosives (a small charge to prop open the lock)</li>
<li>We see the third floor, its a large open space that’s completely dark and filled with barrels and crates; in the center is a smaller room, we can’t make out what’s in it</li>
<li>Marlow fails a booby trap check and runs forward but there’s nothing there so he got lucky (he got a Nat 1 and just ran forward like “this is totally safe! :D”)</li>
<li>Big metal plates are welded and a heavy blast door is protecting what’s in the center</li>
<li>On the first floor, the phantom throws a mini disco ball that explodes (fucking Jane Doe got caught in it lmao); everyone who gets caught in Phantom’s Groove Grenade (the guards all start dancing, Jane Doe resists); he says “get your funk on” and walks up to the second floor</li>
<li>Breacher talks to Jane Doe and says if she continues her pursuit, Breacher will reveal all sorts of shit to the Council (this is being broadcast throughout the compound)</li>
<li>I beseech with Breacher that she should stand down, we can apprehend her (not kill); she says that’s cute, and she doesn’t have time to be apprehended</li>
<li>Jett asks that Breacher tell the truth, asks if she’s a terrorist; Breacher says she’s the only one trying to save the world</li>
<li>Jane Doe will not stand down</li>
<li>Marlow senses a strain of temporal energy coming from the chamber; some little orb fizzles and falls powerless (a drone?)</li>
<li>Robo-Clown pulls out her Vice President sword and summons William A. Wheeler (Rutherford B. Hayes’s vp I think); the wheel (Wheeler is a wheel) barrels Clown up to the third floor</li>
<li>Robo-Clown asks Breacher what she meant about the end of the world; she explains, and I argue that if order descends everything will end anyway; Breacher she’ll choose the slim chance of hope over certain death anyway; Clown says I should hear Breacher out considering I’m gonna kill her, and I shout back that I won’t kill her</li>
<li>Jett asks Jane Doe what Breacher means; she says she’ll explain, but also says that Breacher’s plan would collapse the timeline entirely over saving a few people</li>
<li>Jett is trying to pry the door open, but is also asking Breacher earnestly to talk with him (last thing that happens before Aryan had to leave)</li>
<li>Breacher attacks Jane downstairs with multiple drones, she single handedly knocks down three and harms a fourth; she’s close by</li>
<li>Jungwon makes to to where Jane is, and they can see us up ahead</li>
<li>Mr. Time hears all about this time war from Breacher’s sound system, and Jane’s people are trying to shoot the speakers out so this info can’t be heard; Breacher has eyes and ears everywhere, so Mr. Time calls aloud to her and ponders who the real terrorist is, though he insists this business needs to be settled by the Council</li>
<li>Breacher mentions Alek Wilde, says the Council didn’t deal with him very well, so she doesn’t trust them; everyone knows now that he’s dead</li>
<li>I argue with Breacher, I say chaos will descend if Breacher gets what she wants; I ask, beg really, how she can go through with that; she says what I’ve hear before, from Malakai, from the Clown… hope is all we have. Chaos is something we can hope through, it may happen, but we can also have something better. That’s worth pursuing over certain doom… Enigma looks down, speechless</li>
<li>Marlow applies his plasma torch to the chamber, Breacher’s drones are dropping like flies</li>
<li>Jane announces Breacher guilty of terrorism and treason, as well as other legal jargon; she mentions Piglet and the Guy, and Breacher cuts her off and says she may be guilty of that, but Jane is guilty of giving up hope for humanity</li>
<li>Jane Doe puts us in a trolley problem hypothetical, and Breacher says this isn’t the trolley problem; Jane insists that everything in existence will end, and Breacher says she has hope</li>
<li>Robo-Clown processes the new info, and says the Watchers plan to end our timeline; Jane argues with all of them, and says this door will open and she will cut down anyone who gets in her way</li>
<li>Mr. Time, convinced by robo-Clown, attacks Jane Doe to subdue her</li>
<li>Marlow is all too eager to get the chance to take down Mr. Time; Mr. Time is right but for the wrong reasons, and as soon as Mr. Time approaches Jane Doe Marlow strikes him with his cane, and swings to clip the Clown in the kneecap to knock her over; his cane interacts with sturdy metal he finds, huh, weird; Marlow decapitates the Clown and kills her (robot)</li>
<li>Jane Doe demands everyone stand down, and Mr. Time isn’t frightened but realizes she has an attack that is contingent on her demand; as Jane Doe swings at Mr. Time, he does a kung-fu motion and kicks her</li>
<li>Jane Doe yells at me to open the door, but I’m conflicted and clutch at my hair the way I do when I’m stressed; I say we shouldn’t be fighting each other… I skip my turn</li>
<li>Jungwon, Chrono-Co, starts shooting at Marlow</li>
<li>I feel a heavy hand on my shoulder, and I feel the christmas spirit; Nich yawns behind me and says he was sleeping in a corner this whole time; I am stressed and explain the situation to him, and he gives me a teddy bear and goes to pry open Breacher’s chamber; I say we’re apprehending not killing</li>
<li>in the chamber, there is a torso and head with machinery attached; Breacher opens a gray eye and gives a piercing stare</li>
<li>Mr. Time delivers some critical damage to Jane Doe, though she is resisting this type of damage</li>
<li>Phantom shouts “everybody stop!”, and everyone feels an urge to dance; I do not dance, but Marlow challenges Mr. Time to a dance battle (Jungwon fails at dancing and gets an owie); I get a -8 energy damage</li>
<li>I walk up to the Breacher chamber; I stare into her eyes, and she stares into mine… this is the real Breacher</li>
<li>Mr. Time and Marlow are dance battle fighting or some shit</li>
<li>I stare into Breacher’s eyes, and she says to me “don’t stop fighting”, before telling me to get away from her for my safety… I turn to Jane Doe and tell her to wait as she runs up, she does so; I say we all need to get out of here, and before she can take a shot… Breacher explodes herself</li>
<li>I am in range and take -6 damage (-12 but I’m resistant to energy); I stare in shock at where Breacher just was</li>
<li>Jane tps out of the way, Mr. Time is also tp’d away to a street during the 80s; Paradox’s work… except, Paradox says that actually wasn’t him</li>
<li>I stare in shock at the exploded Breacher hull… she’s dead… Jane yells at me to detain and I’m snapped out of it, I get a Nat12 to detain Jungwon but she’s slippery and is able to get away from my grasp, but we pursue and are able to restrain and detain her (Jane is being merciful, we’ll be taking Jungwon to custody)</li>
<li>Jane says we need to worry about those sympathetic to SH, and we believe they have been dealt with</li>
<li>Nich asks Jane about why Breacher killed herself, and Jane says Breacher wasn’t willing to be detained</li>
<li>I ask Jane is we know where Holly is, and we believe she’s raising an army in the moon mines with the religiously indoctrinated miners; Chrono-Co won’t be happy about us invading the moon mines and taking Holly but we’re doing it anyway</li>
<li>Marlow says he knows a Knight councilor is a spy from some of his intel; Marlow plans to surround all the Knights’ Councilors and weed out the one</li>
<li>We believe Dalton will cooperate with us, and we suspect attacks from Holly and Rachel; Dr. Zephyr and Regina Cho could go anywhere, and we’re thinking we can get Cho on our side; Enrique and Caleb would fall to Dalton</li>
<li>Moon mines have cut off contact to the chronite we need, so we need to get that secured</li>
<li>As a result of today’s mission, we gain an additional ability</li>
<li>Marlow now knows from Nich asking me that I am not just a temp refugee, but one from an erased timeline</li>
<li>Jane tells us the Knights councilors will be fighting with Holland; everyone is pretty sure it is Tuhorn even though I LITERALLY TESTIFIED IT WAS FUCKING TUHORN</li>
<li>Jane wants Mr. Time removed as he’s now problematic; her wand is what sent Mr. Time away, but she couldn’t control where he went</li>
<li>She says some people know about the ultimate plan, herself, Larry and Lone Master, Madame E isn’t out of her receptacle and we might need to extract her; Eyes Unseen is unknown to anyone, and the Whisperer is also a mystery</li>
<li>Marlow asks me about a message that was sent about my bomb removal, I confirm it was sent by Morgana (I didn’t know she even sent a message); I ask how he got this info, he says he got it from encrypted Second Hand messages (I can’t fully tell if he’s lying, but maybe); I confirm for them Tuhorn was a main spy</li>
<li>Jake Robertson is still alive apparently, and Marlow no longer suspects Larry (we do now have a running gag that Marlow and Larry are fucking)</li>
<li>Jane confirms only a select few will live after the apocalypse, the Watchers would downsize</li>
<li>Jane confirms Larry is with us and I elbow Marlow</li>
<li>Not canonically with me but Clown was suicidal and Tracker took her to Brazil to make a little grave for Breacher; they pour one out
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OBJECTIVES: Get an AC unit gun from Dr. Zephyr (ask for Watcher money), get to Dr. Rain’s lab and observe the chronite
Find the stability tech and deliver it +plans to LRS, trap Holly in my pocket watch and give her to LRS [tell them about Grasshopper’s betrayal and to evacuate, +to trap LRS so anyone who comes looking will get trapped])</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chronicler #5: Holly has declared war and threatened to blow up the moon; Minutemen are shaken up after Breacher Dustin and Alek Wilde were killed; Knights want automaton use to fight Holly but the bots are being decommissioned; the Councilors are dropping like flies</p>

<p>Morgana was given permission to view the presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Presentation
Members: Morgana, Cipher (Nate; Izzy’s Drone), Simon, Nicholas Aurora, Magpie</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I walk into my room in the Knights barracks to find fucking everyone there (including Izzy and Morgana…); I argue with Simon on why the fuck everyone is in my room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morgana is coily and purposefully knocking my shit over; I try and totally don’t fail to hide how much I am seething; Simon says at this point this is kind of his room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He proceeds to go on a tangent about aliens (he thinks Nicholas is an alien) and reveals he surgically removed his left hand and replaced it with a right hand (I hit my head against the wall)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Capturing Holly Holland</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Larry chimes in and says we need to be ready for the missions (I stand up straight and go into an “at attention” stance, losing all emotion in my expression); he tells me and Nich privately we have machines that will be set up around the area and we are to assist, temporal threaders; Larry’s got it under control (HDTF specifically); we are to destroy Holly’s tech once we’ve got her trapped in the alt timeline, and no matter what she shouldn’t be allowed to escape; Cleric Orlaith will debrief us on the rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its been about three days since Breacher’s death…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith says for Holly its been 300 days (for us 3) so she’s had time to train her army; the moon mines are a fortress now; the mines lower rooms (which Morgana and I were at in the Ace mission); using the refineries Holly built will be useful; once we’re in the alt timeline we are to fight, take Holly and destroy the tech in this side, before coming back to the Watch Tower and destroying her tech on that side</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith makes it clear to not destroy the tech until all her Knights are out of the alt timeline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holly can jump with her watch so we need to plan around that, Larry has a plan… destroying Holland and her tech will kill this resistance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we can get some of the fluid, Chron-Co would like to observe it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Primary objective: kill Holland. Secondary: deal with the alt timeline tech, make sure its out of Holland’s hands (doesn’t need to be destroyed but it can be if we must). Third: Hold the moon mines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I take one stim, some explosives (3 charges, you can use all at once for a big boom)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knights want us to hold the stabilizer technology, Larry tells us to destroy it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we blow up the mines it might do temp damage to everyone so we should be careful with that… given we’re not planning it on purpose that is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith and Creel in one jet, Glasg and MacIntyre in another; Clinton, Thorwald, Hadvar not coming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Izzy is controlling a robot named Cypher since she’s under house arrest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith shouts at us to get in the goddamn jets lmao</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I recall the layout, and our main thing is to get through to the alt timeline; the people are traveling into and out of the room we weren’t able to get through last time (the one the fucking pope walked through last time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mines have multiple entry points and opportunities for stealth, but there’s only one entry to the alt timelines (the pope room); once we pass into the alt timeline, we’re going into enemy territory with no idea what’s on the other side</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I set out a plan; we stealth to the elevator, Magpie invisible goes down the elevator and scouts for us, giving us the clear; we go down and sneak into the alt timeline before Holly’s people can know we’re coming, once we’ve scouted ahead we call the Knights and they do a siege, which will distract so we can pursue Holly and the stabilizer tech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich can’t be seen by children or we’ll be spotted, but he’s invisible to adults; he pulls out a snowglobe that he warps into and Magpie carries with her; she gets a good idea of the layout and sees explosives and such lying around</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tons of guards are around with turrets; the elevator is not there, its on the lower level so Magpie would have to descend down the shaft; she descends and thankfully nothing happens (she had to roll for booby trap detection and failed but there were none thank fuck)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie shimmies and squeezes through the shaft, and Simon’s detachable hand accompanies her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie heads to the refinery and accidentally trips a laser sensor; she’s not spotted but the guards are confused and sus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There’s space suits and such (we are on the moon), the refinery (i kept calling it the dispensary because adhd) is no longer actively producing chronite and time fluid, but weapons (its been repurposed for weapons manufacturing); out third objective was to make sure this didn’t get into Holly’s hands, and we were to try and keep it intact but would destroy it if necessary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie looks around more and goes to the labs; the relevant info from last time we missed out on has mostly been moved, though big metal doors lead to areas that would have helpful info; scraps and pieces of machinery and time fluid are scattered but we know not why, the timeline stabilization tech from this side of the portal was most likely in the lab before it was moved</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie decides to leave the lab area for someone with higher tech and goes to investigate the timeline room we need to access; the guards are flocking more to the refinery cause that’s where Mag tripped the sensors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie sees discs where you travel through (the big discs we saw last time were portals); people are swarming through and come towards Magpie (they don’t see her, but she has to duck so they don’t bump into her accidentally)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A guy inside the refinery gives a rousing speech, and Magpie lays bombs on the capsules delivering weapons (we’re trying to avoid setting off the temporal fluid)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie quietly leaves and detonates the bombs after setting off the explosives; unfortunately they had a blast door close so the explosion wasn’t big enough, and the guards are not distracted</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon’s detached arm finds a rocket launcher and sets it off; he fires it off with all his explosives because he’s goddamn insane and blows up ALL THE CHRONITE (it was recommended we don’t do that, and considering the Watchers wanted it all destroyed this is NOT good)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon, the dumbass, created a black fucking hole that is starting to suck up everything; its a singularity, it won’t suck up the entire moon or anything but it will be an issue for a hot minute before it stabilizes itself; Magpie starts getting sucked in after taking like -22 energy damage from the blast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie can fly apparently; she flew multiple times I just didn’t mention it; she’s able to shimmy past the elevator into the shaft before it falls to the bottom, thankfully the singularity is dying out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guards around the shaft left and we with the Knights drop down to the bottom floor (most of the Holland guards fucking died so we’re just charging into the timeroom; the labs and refinery are destroyed entirely)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith tells us that MacIntyre and Glasgow didn’t show up (they were supposed to by now…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We get ready to fight through to the portal; we have two machine gunner and the lever guy (you have to activate a lever to go through the portal)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie wounds one of the gunners, and Morgana kills him with the chain gun; she misses the other machine gunner, and he retaliates and misses; Nich attacks the lever man; I miss hitting lever guy with my temp gun; I try to strike up a convo about us getting pissed at Simon screwing up bringing back memories, and Morgana snarks me as we fight, and digs at me about the Knights being dead or arrested (sh says my old gun was one of a kind sarcastically and I shoot a death glare)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morgana shoots the chain gun and heavily wounds the machine gun guy (and accidentally almost friendly-fires a Knight); she’s able to take him down but gets downed herself as Magpie takes damage (apparently the first gunner wasn’t dead and Tracker popped a cap in lever guy so he’s dead, there’s still one gunner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I rush over to stabilize Morgana, Simon gave us a cool extra action buff so i’m able to basically advantage it and she’s up; we’re able to get the gunner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tell the Knights to go in shields up and prepare to get attacked, tank it with shields before you have an opening to counter attack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knights control the room now, and we heal our injured; Larry Morton enters the room, and I straighten up and lose emotion; he says he’s here for Watcher stuff and everyone else can “do you”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100 seconds there is one here; we go through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We enter alternate timeline mines on earth where chronite is being harvested; Holly’s people are in religious garb, they’re part of her cult</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morgana notices Larry nodding at his squadron of Watchers who go to the left tunnel (they all have pocket watches); Orlaith doesn’t notice or care, she wants Holland</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magpie and Cypher want to spy on the Watchers; I go to find Holland with Nich, Simon and Tracker Morgana</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morgana recalls the story of her hand to Simon and they bond over amputations (I awkwardly look away)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon uses his left right hand as a drone to scout ahead so we know which tunnel leads to Holly Holland; his drone sees 4 gunners blocking a door, most likely where Holly is</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon tries to set off an explosive behind the guys but is noticed, they dart back and shoot at it to set it off; the bomb doesn’t get them but it does open the door, which leads to a chapel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point, Morgana snuck off… me, Nich, Simon and Tracker take on these guards and surprise them</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I hit some of them, I wound one; Simon says we should leave; Tracker throws a grenade and shouts for Nich to get out of range; Nich fails his agility and Tracker tosses EVERY GRENADE; 3 are all wounded, one is down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simon has no arms so he rushes one like an idiot and kicks at them, Tracker suggests shooting them with the arm he attached to Simon but Simon says fuck it and rushes, he somehow manages to kill one of them (brilliant, but he is in range of fire); ngl it was pretty badass</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracker shoots one and kills them; I obliterate the last one with my energy gun</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tracker uses his dog sonar to locate that one person is in the chapel, hiding and cowering; its the pope; I aggressively grab him and point my gun at him, demanding to know where Enigma is; he cowers and says she normally gives a sermon and she’s deeper in, the pope doesn’t know where she is but there’s a room in the back where Holland usually comes from; I go to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pope thinks Nich is a devil and bows to him in fear because Nich says he is god; Tracker is civil and asks if Holly has any clothing he can smell (to track)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside the room is Holly’s area, there’s biblical text, I see a closet and take clothes and toss them to Tracker so he can sniff; I fail to hack her computer and Simon gives Nich instructions to hack it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We find emails about a central room with an ultimate stabilizer, which is most likely where she is (Tracker can get us to her); there will most likely be resistance, and lots of temporal tech (might wanna stick to the energy gun)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While we wait I tape a knife to Simon’s other stump; he has a gun hand and a knife hand; Cipher appears and Nich asks where Morgana is, and how she got here on her own when she was with Magpie; she’s being very dodgy about it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich pulls me aside and says Cipher is planning to kill Larry along with Morgana and Magpie; I learn that Larry says if they cause problems, we can just leave them here when we destroy the timeline (which confuses me because Larry said Morgana had a place at the end of the world in the Hemlock base); I call Larry and he says Morgana is being too problematic, so if I can’t detain her today, she needs to be left behind</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich says he can put me inside his snowglobe which is like a pokeball and so we can escape together; I don’t want to leave Morgana, and he says we can detain Morgana in the globe with me as well, where I can talk to her and she won’t be let out until she agrees (he says he will be able to hear and see everything that happens inside)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich is going to use his globe destruction to destroy the stabilizer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Me and Nich come back to Cypher using one of the dead gunner’s hands and reattaching it to Simon so he has a human hand (attached to his metal arm)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morgana and Magpie are still missing; Tracker has us hide behind a wall while Orlaith and the Knights catch up to us and bust through the door ahead, helping us get closer to Holly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich gives Cipher a christmas hat and after tech checking it she puts it on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reach the central chambers, and I tp to the door to hack it (-1); I fail and slam my fist against the door (I left the others behind)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The others make it through and Simon hacks the door; a large chamber is in the center with blue energy pulsing, and a whole river of temporal energy is getting absorbed; up ahead a second pope is talking to Holly Holland; she pulls out a staff that she points out at the sky along with the pope; I shoot at her staff and miss</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cipher gets chucked by Tracker and is by the stabilizer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A little yellow beam is shot by Holly’s staff at me but it misses; the pope shoots a lightning bolt at me and it also misses; two of Holland’s crusaders (there’s 4) attack me and ALSO MISS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cipher plugs her fourth tongue into the stabilizer and drinks in data; Tracker pushes one of the crusaders into the temporal moat but fails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holly targets me and I hear a voice in my head whispering to me to go into the fluid; I resist, and take -3 mental damage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich successfully pulls the staff out of Holly’s hand; the Pope fires at us and lets off a glitter bomb (i get a Nat 12 on dodging)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nich gets downed next to me; I tp us back to where Tracker and Simon are (-2) and I have the staff</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We feel power in our watches as a large rupture reverberates; the stabilizer stabilizes, surprising Holly</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holly cowers behind the pope and demands the crusaders attack us; Simon heals Nich</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith comes through to Simon and says the mines are destabilizing, and we should have enough time to escape (the timeline is threading itself back in and ripping itself apart, though it is doing so very slowly; the Knights should be able to escape); Orlaith says we should keep the stabilizer in tact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Pope shoots a bolt at Simon; a crusader hits me and misses</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I tp behind Holly (-1) and grab her, using her as a hostage so the pope can’t hit me; Orlaith charges in and Tracker, Simon and Cipher start to retreat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cipher says an ominous “oh Enigma…” before going away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am able to keep Holly from breaking my grasp; i use 1 TU (-4 charges, needed a TU) to tp us to another room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I deck her in the face and say that was for the mines; she tells me to kill her and get it over with, but I say I have something different in mind… -1 TU to put her in my pocket watch, and before I leave I make a gash in my arm and smear my own blood all over myself… -3 charges to get out</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I appear with the others, covered in blood with a dark look in my eye… Cipher asks me if I did it. I give a look. She asks if it was worth it… I look down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I realize Orlaith isn’t present, and I didn’t see Larry, Jane, Morgana, Magpie, or the Watchers escape</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I use 1 TU to tp to Orlaith (-2 charges), and I tp back to Nich (-2 tp, my final charges of TU) and he puts me in the workshop; me and the others are all safe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orlaith is livid about the Watchers fucking with the stabilizers, and the Knights think the Watchers may have deliberately sabotaged everything; MacIntyre says they don’t trust the Watchers, and the Knights will hide out in here; I release Orlaith</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We go to the CTE hoping to find Morgana and Magpie, but we see only Magpie. I ask Magpie if everyone is ok, and ask where Morgana is… Magpie glares at me, and dumps Morgana’s corpse out of her pocketwatch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like she was killed with a sword cane… Jane Doe…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I walk up to her. Observe the body. Check for a pulse… Magpie snarks me but I don’t even hear her… I stand up and walk away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Magpie harvests Morgana’s organs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Knights are scraped up but the leadership is strong and hiding in the moon mines; they believe the Watchers purposefully attacked them; Simon shows his Knight bosses a video from clown-bot of Marlow requesting of Jane Doe to dissolve the Council (Jane said no so she’s not incriminated)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I learn after that the stabilizer tried to weave this timeline back into the proper timeline (this was an alt timeline) and that is what made the timeline collapse slower, as in keeping the timeline alive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Enigma the Defector</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I removed my Watcher GPS and left it at the Knights barracks before heading off to speak with MacIntyre (also confirmed I had no other bugs, just the one)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I talk with MacIntyre, and inquire on the possibility of a Knight councilor working for the Second Hand…
(Nat12 character roll) he picks up what I’m putting down, and I coyly speak of where one might drop off one Holly Holland were she to still be alive; he gives me the LRS coords, and tells me a bit about knowing Breacher back in the day. We both hope for the best, and I head off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At LRS, I drop off Holly Holland with Piglet, Riley and the bunch. I warn them about Grasshopper, and Marlow being able to access their encrypted messages;after a remark hoping I won’t turn tail again, I assure them I know where I stand now, then leave</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPS tracker back on, Zephyr analyzes my chronite from the mines; he says there is one interesting implication, about being able to jump back in time at different rates; it would help for dilating a timeline a little bit, though not much else</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I commission a new gun from Zephyr, and he creates an AC model-type gun (1d12 + tech to hit, 2d6 + tech damage, physical or energy of my choosing each time)
*Upgrades:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advantage on all checks against Larry Morton</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While I’m downed I can do an action; can’t get myself up but for example I could get a last shot in</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Find out how to build timeline stabilizer and take down Watcher higher ups; contact Clown and Rosemary</p>
<h1 id="unofficial-session-sat-713">Unofficial Session (Sat, 7/13)</h1>
<p>Rosemary</p>
<ul>
<li>Rosemary chills in her room, on her bed browsing emails. She is startled when a figure is watching her in the corner, a figure with a purple glow in her eyes… Enigma asks if the two can talk</li>
<li>I take Rosemary to a discrete location and fill her in; the time war escalates as a result of the factions fighting each other, so they must all be kept intact and from destroying each other; I ask her to do what she can to keep Chrono-Co from taking advantage of attacks against Watchers that would destroy us entirely or give Chrono-Co too much power with the power vacuum</li>
<li>She still doesn’t fully trust me, but she’ll do her best; I make a point about how not all Watchers are bad and they deserve a chance to rebuild, and she agrees while looking pointedly at me… I hold out my hand for her, she takes it, and I bring her back to her home before heading off
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
OBJECTIVE: Visit Morgana and Breacher</li>
</ul>
<p>Stabilizers (Sun, 7/14)
Chronicler #5 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWlmOjvG_RWnjfwjpZjssR7-b607Hu5o0O1sgyVuE6g/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RWlmOjvG_RWnjfwjpZjssR7-b607Hu5o0O1sgyVuE6g/edit</a>
Members: Juniper Snow (Viv), Rosemary, Magpie, Sidney Stockton, Simon Bastil, Nicholas Aurora
I DON’T KNOW THIS CANONICALLY I WASN’T HERE</p>
<ul>
<li>Magpie breaks the news to the Ace Squad,and fills them in on the moon mines fight (as well as Breacher’s death, Holly’s death, and Anderson’s death)</li>
<li>This crew has parts that needs to be shipped but they need help transporting; SH need these parts to build the stabilizer, Tasha’s vault, Holly’s timeline engines, Anderson’s stuff, and Watcher shit that I knew got stolen and it was FUCKING MAGPIE AND SIMON (I don’t know this canonically)</li>
<li>The crew has to jump to Old Earth to deliver it (Izzy’s there…); they aren’t sure how to transfer the stuff, they’ll need Chrono-Co connections but they don’t want Chrono-Co knowing</li>
<li>Orlaith wants war with the Watchers but MacIntyre is trying to keep that from happening for secret reasons (he can’t explain why but I did ask him earlier to put off fighting for as long as possible, and to make sure the Watchers were crippled but not destroyed entirely)</li>
<li>Magpie is aware of a prophecy and she made a realization; the prophecy was “Knight will fall on Dutch shores, and end this war forever more. And start the war between the brave, a ship becomes a second’s grave” (she realized this meant the Knights were supposed to die in the Holland mines, “Holland” = dutch)</li>
<li>This crew has a ship but because of the prophecy Magpie doesn’t want to use it for the transport; Rosemary hits up Dalton to get some pocket watches for a “photoshoot”, though that does mean they’re leaving a cyber trail; they get 5 pocket watches and Dalton’s sending them a photographer (the last one went missing, totally not stuck in the mental mines of Mr. Time’s subconscious…); Rosemary insists this isn’t the final shoot, they just need the watches; Dalton is convinced (he also mentions they are the ones producing Moon Detective, and they still don’t know where Mr. Time is)</li>
<li>Dalton mentioned a Dalton family ball, a masquerade… shit (I don’t know canonically I just know ooc); Clinton and MacIntyre accepted an invitation (though Clinton is also missing); Councilors are invited and can bring a plus one, and Rosemary is invited (Wednesday 5:30pm)</li>
<li>Rosemary walks out and meets Juniper Snow, sent by The Eyes Unseen (she’s a Watcher); she straight up admits to knowing the world is ending by the Watchers hands lmao</li>
<li>Marlow learned where the old drop point is, so SH has new communication channels; Nicholas joins the crew (I’m assuming he joined with Juniper)</li>
<li>At this point they did private call things and I was kicked :[ (I got summoned to call by accident and fucking Breacher was there LMAO there goes that plot twist; the name was “Pheonix” but like… cmon now)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="visiting-morgana-and-breacher">Visiting Morgana and Breacher</h1>
<ul>
<li>I arrive in the Amazon after having left my GPS back in the Knights barracks; two graves are in the jungle up ahead</li>
<li>(something about this place is familiar, but I’ll think about that later…)</li>
<li>I plop myself down in front of them and attempt to break the ice with a joke. It falls flat because I am not good at jokes</li>
<li>I say Isabel sent me, that she is not doing well but I’ll do what I can to keep her going. I say she misses the two</li>
<li>I apologize to Breacher for killing Alek (with Jett, I realize at this point I still have his job money and should find it before Magpie tries to rob me)</li>
<li>I bring up that faction fighting is what causes the end, so I’m trying to keep that from happening; I say a Watcher has to kill the Watcher higher ups so a power vacuum doesn’t open, and well, I suppose that should be me</li>
<li>I say my planning hasn’t been the best, but I finally hit up Izzy and we’re talking again… its not like the old days, but we’re working together at least</li>
<li>I say I have plans for Marlow, and that I would like to save him from all of this; I realize how much he’ll hate me when he realizes I’ve betrayed him, but that’s my own fault for betraying the others first. Laying in your bed and all that</li>
<li>I talk of the possibility of killing the Councilors; I promise Morgana I’ll stab Jane Doe with her own cane, as for Larry… (I start drawing in the dirt with a stick) once Larry is dead, this new shift in the Watch Tower that will come from us altering the timeline will feel all the more real. Whatever new future lays ahead, the death of the man who raised me will make it feel all the more real (I must, its my responsibility). Its all terrifying, everything will change (maybe it already has)</li>
<li>I talk about how when Larry first brought me in, he’d talk about how if you climbed the Watcher chain you could become a Councilor… its been a dream of mine, before I realized it would entail talking to people that is. But now, with how little Councilors will be left, someone has to be there to pick up the pieces and rebuild both the Watcher and the Watch Tower… I’ll dedicate my life to this, should I survive</li>
<li>I’m about ready to go, and say my final goodbyes… I can’t get the words right, what I rehearsed is too hard to say and my throat’s closing up; I lean forward, resting my hands on either grave, and finally admit how much I miss them. That I don’t care if the whole world hates me, I would do anything to get them back… but that’s not how this world, I can’t bring them back. All I can do is move forward and stand for what they stood for</li>
<li>I promise them that as scared as I am, I have hope. I want to improve the Watcher and the Watch Tower, and I will fight for that future. I promise.</li>
<li>I give them one last smirk, say “see you on the other side”, and depart</li>
<li>I get a call from Larry about some work that needs to be done… so let’s get to work
OBJECTIVES: Keep in touch with allies (Izzy/stabilizers, Eyes/Marlow), contact Sidney Stockton? (will need Watcher power), break out Tuhorn and Brad, get connected with other Watcher councilors, unveil Watcher secrets and intercept plans, contact Jett about keeping Minutemen from fueling war?</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="out-of-session-3-eyes-unseen-masquerade-prep">Out of Session 3: Eyes Unseen; Masquerade Prep</h1>
<p>Larry’s skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>His Threads are very strange, and feel almost like they have a mind of their own. When attached, they can drain a target, stealing their life or even progressing them quickly through time.</li>
<li>The Threads can control limbs they are embedded in: by default those limbs just go numb, but things could be worse…</li>
<li>Larry is seen talking to his threads often.</li>
<li>Larry’s Watch is custom, and is the spool around which the threads are wrapped. It seems to warp and shift in shape, as if its properties change.</li>
<li>Larry has ~20 threads</li>
<li>Larry’s favorite appetizer is Deviled Eggs</li>
</ul>
<p>OBJECTIVES: Prevent Thorwald from being killed at the masquerade (work with Nicholas and maybe Simon)</p>
<h1 id="dalton-family-ball-wed-717">Dalton Family Ball (Wed, 7/17)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Enigma has her formal wear (and a carnival mask… where did she get that from?)</li>
<li>Phoenix has bright red hair and look sort of like Damien with their getup</li>
<li>Mr. Time, John Time, is back</li>
<li>Eyes’ drone has a little bowtie on it</li>
<li>Phantom of the Disco boogies it out with a mask peacock, and Jett does a cringe 70s disco move because he’s from the 70s</li>
<li>I am patted down for security, and I am told by the guard that there is word of a potential terrorist plot; I give up my pocket watch and guns (they’re a bit sus of me cause I didn’t do a good job hiding it but I’m welcomed in)</li>
<li>First floor has most of the party-going, ballroom, theater showing old spy films (spies and alibis is the party theme); there’s a courtyard and a hedge maze; the Moon Detective will be here (the actor); there’s a museum with a portion closed off to special guests; basement is off limits</li>
<li>I am escorted by Larry who says he’s going to the dorms for some deviled eggs, and he has some things to do (our mission), he says his signature “you do you” and leaves with a snap and a smirk</li>
<li>I am at the ballroom and Izzy walks up to me; its awkward, I’m surprised she’s here and concerned for her safety but she says she’s safe enough</li>
<li>Izzy is happy to see me and I awkwardly tell her I will consider this night worth it to have seen her (we are avoiding the elephant in the room, but we clearly missed each other)</li>
<li>Izzy asks me to dance, says my target isn’t here yet and I should enjoy myself; I don’t know how, but I can’t say no to Izzy so I agree</li>
<li>We dance and talk; we discuss our targets, and Izzy says for her its been 24 days (I accidentally says “WHAT” too loud)</li>
<li>Nicholas cheerily interrupts (I am VERY annoyed that he cut off our convo) and he is invisible to everyone and simply a floating santa hat (its required for security so he can be tracked)</li>
<li>Nich says he has no idea how his magic works and talks</li>
<li>Right as Nich says he will excuse himself, Phantom and Rosemary walk up (i am… SO annoyed)</li>
<li>Phantom struts up to me and greets me; I am very annoyed and he leaves</li>
<li>Rosemary wants to talk to Cecilia and is very shy</li>
<li>I learn the Phantom is the Watchers drug dealer (I am pissed at him cause those random blunts I found was apparently from him); Izzy desperately tries to calm me down</li>
<li>Phantom tries to “steal” Izzy from me; I pull her back and threaten to put him back into whatever hole he came from</li>
<li>Phantom whisks away Dalton to dance</li>
<li>Izzy encourages Rosemary to dance with Cecilia, and she’s scared shitless (I am very confused; I don’t know about her crush); I wrongly deduce Cecilia is a target of assassination</li>
<li>I tell Phantom he should dance with Larry, Izzy tries to stop him; he starts dancing with other people and somehow incorporates hip thrusts into a waltz</li>
<li>Me, Izzy and Rosemary go to the hedge maze; Izzy inquiries on of hedgehogs are related to hedges and I say they resemble hedges and probably were named as such; I must go to Jane and depart (I am clearly sad to leave); izzy makes me promise not to die on her, and I say it would it be foolish of me to die when people (Izzy) are relying on me</li>
<li>Izzy gives me a hug and I freeze for a second before tentatively putting my arms around her and patting her on the back; I awkwardly leave in a rush because I’m flustered</li>
<li>I enter the theater to speak with Jane and fine some of the Ace squad (Miri, Sidney, Magpie, Juniper); Juniper has a mask that looks like a speaker, and she’s wearing gray and looks metallic; the mask makes her eyes look yellow (she looks like AC…)</li>
<li>I lean against the wall waiting for Jane; Miri walks up to me and says she doesn’t like talking to people either; I ask how the search for Selene is going and Miri sadly says she doesn’t know, she might just need to get used to living without people; I am sad for her, but before i can respond Ncholas interrupts FUCKING AGAIN</li>
<li>Nich and I speak in private, and his snowglobes have been confiscated; we have no idea what’s going on, apparently Nicholas’ contacts changed their minds on killing Larry to exposing him</li>
<li>Phantom joins us with Cecilia Dalton in tow (she’s giving him a tour); Nicholas tells Phantom when he gives a signal, Phantom should make everyone dance; Phantom gives everyone a disco blunt including Cecilia</li>
<li>Jane Doe brings me aside and says the hit on Thorwald was false, a way of testing my loyalty (I passed); she suspects Nicholas is a spy; she says I need to cause a distraction and get everyone in a frenzy (she won’t tell me what our mission is); I need to make it so “they” follow me</li>
<li>Of course, I know this is about a hit on Dalton but Jane doesn’t know I know; I join Nicholas as he’s talking to Dalton where he requests to go into an off-limits area that is fully booked (the museum); Dalton says so many people want to talk to him in private (Larry, Time, etc)</li>
<li>I warn Nicholas my hit job was a fake and he’s suspected as a spy</li>
<li>I walk in on Rosemary losing it over seeing Phantom successfully swooning Cecilia; (I might not know this canonically) she lets slip that apparently Holly and Cecilia were in an deranged marriage at some point; Tracker talks to her and tries to help her out; she spills her crush on Cecilia to Tracker; Tracker also knows about the end of the world; he consoles her and Rosemary apparently recognizes him and he’s embarrassed from some incident; something about Izzy and Tracker being embarrassed??? (oh hell no)</li>
<li>I walk up to Tracker and ask if they recognize the new Knight Phoenix; he says no (I failed a roll to see if he was lying… he doesn’t trust me does he?)</li>
<li>We congregate in the theater; (I don’t know this) Juniper saw Jane throw something away while tailing her and got the paper</li>
<li>Cecilia is sad cause her wife died, who was apparently Holly, who I apparently killed. That’s fucking hilarious</li>
<li>Mr. Time is back and I inquire how he got back; he says he was in 1980s New Jersey and was saved by Jett; his distress beacon was what got him aid (they left through typical methods)</li>
<li>I try to chat up Izzy who is alone in the dance room but Rosemary interrupts (GODDAMMIT); Izzy says she was in the hedge maze and Larry was there earlier supposedly hunting her? Or someone else…</li>
<li>I am very afraid for Izzy and tell her to stick to Rosemary and “tail” me under the guise I am suspicious so I can keep them in my line of sight + do what Jane told me to do</li>
<li>I finally piece together that Rosemary has a thing for Cecilia, and is heartbroken cause Cecilia is supposedly with Phantom; me and Izzy give her love talk, and I say that if the end of the world and war isn’t enough to take a chance, I don’t know what is</li>
<li>Izzy sees threads from Larry pointing towards the maze, but he’s leaving the maze (I don’t know this)</li>
<li>Magpie pretends she’s having diarrhea to seem like she’s not doing what she’s actually doing and I walk by knowing its mouth noises and thinking she’s a fucking weirdo</li>
<li>I text Larry asking if I can do anything else; he says “You’ve already done enough, Christmas is coming early”&hellip;I tell Nicholas</li>
<li>Phantom kisses Cecilia, and outside they hear a grunt of pain…?</li>
<li>I wish to find Larry and Izzy is very against it; we argue as she insists it doesn’t matter if he trusts me, he might try to kill me;</li>
<li>Simon appears and I make him and Time mingle (he reveals he was a teacher in 1984 Jersey and was a police dispatcher at some point who is accidentally caused Jett’s wife’s death)</li>
<li>Me, Rosemary and Izzy storm up to up to cockblock Phantom so Rosemary can confess to Cecilia, only to see Orlaith attacking Cecilia with her shillelagh</li>
<li>I run into the green fire that surrounds her (-5 energy damage) and attempt to arm lock her while tping her away from Cecilia (Orlaith looks strange, and is unnaturally strong and swift… Larry’s buffs); I fail and am thrown off; I call for everyone to incapacitate Orlaith not kill</li>
<li>Rosemary is able to keep her from getting a swing on Cecilia by saying she gets how the British were able to colonize Ireland (Orlaith’s from ancient Ireland) and Orlaith turns on Rosemary</li>
<li>Rosemary vibe checks Orlaith and feels that her mind is empty save for an extreme anger; Rosemary texts Juniper asking for a way to detach Larry’s threads (she asked me for methods but I have none)</li>
<li>Izzy bursts a water pipe that brings down some of the fire around her (there’s a drone around Orlaith that’s spitting fire)</li>
<li>Rosemary sends a distress to Juniper, and I send one to Nicholas</li>
<li>Rosemary and Izzy protect Cecilia and Phantom is downed; she’s able to down them both and charges at Cecilia; I try to tp Cecilia out to a secluded area (-8 energy damage going through the fire again, and Orlaith hits me -21); I am downed</li>
<li>Izzy opens up a hole under her and Orlaith and falls unconscious hitting the ground (she didn’t want to risk using her hourglass where there are people watching)</li>
<li>Orlaith runs out of the room and burns random people on the way, including the Moon Detective actor; she runs to go back up to us</li>
<li>Cecilia stabilizes Phantom (we rolled a 1d2 for if she saved Phantom or Rosemary and it went to him); Magpie finally reaches us and begs Cecilia to get in her pocket watch and it works (she flies away from Orlaith); Orlaith can’t find Cecilia and taps her shillelagh looking for invisible creatures, and Magpie is able to avoid being detected</li>
<li>Security runs in; Magpie stims and stabilizes Rosemary; Orlaith twirls on them and hits Rosemary, downing her again; someone on the lower floor has stabilized Izzy; I’m on one death turn</li>
<li>Phantom of the disco runs out of death saves, and dies</li>
<li>Security shoots at Orlaith; Magpie flies down to stim me with all she’s got and I am upped (I get a Nat12 to not get downed again); I fail to up Rosemary, and the guards shooting at Orlaith don’t listen to me shouting to not kill her</li>
<li>Juniper hears me and summons a wall to surround Orlaith; her roll outrolls Orlaith and it stuns Orlaith</li>
<li>Dr. Rain stops time so Phoenix can run up and up Rosemary; we tell her we need to convince the guards not to kill Orlaith; its effective in getting to the guards but their orders were to kill; she convinces some of them that Orlaith is not in her right mind</li>
<li>Phoenix can see threads; we hear Jane Doe walking up the steps… Phoenix prepares an illusion, and Nicholas finally appears and pokeballs me (I’m on 1hp)</li>
<li>Juniper drops the shield and the group attempts to down Orlaith and stabilize</li>
<li>Jane Doe tells the security the group are suspected Second Hand; Rosemary has a camera in her mask that gives clear evidence of what happened, though Jane Doe has footage of Magpie’s pocket watch having explosives (Magpie didn’t put those in, they were planted on her); she also has footage of Nich pokeballing Dalton; security is confused but they did know about potential SH people doing shit; she also shows evidence of Marlow saying he wants to stage a coup and Nich saying he wanted to kill Larry and kidnap Will Dalton from the HGTF chat (&hellip; oops)</li>
<li>The cameras in the building are capable of seeing the threads Jane used to puppet Orlaith, the group just needs to get their hands on it</li>
<li>Nicholas goes to another room with cameras, I am let out and feign thinking this invisible person forced me into a pocket dimension, and i lunge at him to tp him out (mission success, we got Dalton out and it looks like I did it on accident)</li>
<li>Magpie pleads with Cecilia to watch the footage of Jane controlling Orlaith while she downloads the footage; Magpie isn’t able to see the threads on the footage; perhaps they need another camera? Magpie is able to convince Cecilia didn’t put explosives in her watch</li>
<li>Magpie gets Cecilia out of there</li>
<li>People are confused where I lie cause i did a shit acting job in the footage; we at least downed Orlaith but now the building is getting stormed</li>
<li>Nicholas has been compromised; Marlow is suspected of wanting to assassinate Larry</li>
<li>We hear word that Clinton apparently abducted the final Dalton (a teen); she’s possibly being possessed</li>
<li>Simon and Izzy dip to the courtyard, me and Nich got out, Magpie got out and Dr. Rain blips; Rosemary, Phoenix, Juniper, and Dr. Rain are still in there; Phantom is fucking dead</li>
<li>Phoenix creates a dark cloud after they got their footage and the rest try to escape (Rosemary pretends to not be with them so she’s staying); Juniper put a shield that takes bullet fire; Jane runs into the darkness and shoots Orlaith… Orlaith is dead; the rest got out</li>
<li>Juniper and Phoenix jump out the window and Juniper splats on the ground prone like wiley coyote; they make a run for it</li>
<li>I realize Phoenix is an octopus cause they release a dark cloud every time there’s danger</li>
<li>Marlow appears by bus so he’s late as fuck canonically after everything already happened</li>
<li>Dr. Rain sees the Chrono-Co people and the HGTF Watchers are in a standoff; she does 50 pushups and blips out</li>
<li>Tensions are high between Chrono-Co, Watchers and Knights; Knights aren’t looking good; HGDF Watchers and Chrono-Co will be a problem</li>
<li>Me and HD whatever were given false info that Dalton was going to be assassinated; Nich was given it by Larry (Jane also can swap appearances)</li>
<li>Nich was originally hired by Marlow to run the intelligence division of the HGDF; Clinton was taken (she didn’t actually kidnap anyone, it was a set up)</li>
<li>Canonically I left my shit at home so its not at the mansion

OBJECTIVES: get concrete evidence of the Watcher Loyalists’ plans to expose them (encryption of Jane’s message on assassinating Thorwald?

<h1 id="the-finale-part-i-stabilizers-fri-719">The Finale Part I: Stabilizers (Fri, 7/19)</h1>
<p>Members: Izzy, Phoenix, Juniper, Simon, Magpie, Sidney, Miri, Damien, Nicholas</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronicler #6 states that Chrono-Co is in shambles with a power vacuum after we abducted the Daltons for their safety; Regina Cho is a bit of a mob boss and has taken over; Doctor Lightborn is reasonable and wishes to speak with the Knights first; Caleb Lloyd is next in line to overtake Chrono-Co, he’s a total nepo baby</li>
<li>The WatchTower has Phoenix, Juniper, Magpie and Nicholas fleeing into the night; Izzy’s cover has been blown, SImon’s fine, same with Rosemary, mine is unknown</li>
<li>Izzy contacts Dr. Zephyr to get him on our side; apparently Grasshopper died and Zeph made her into a zombie (rip Magpie’s lover); she asks him for help on a stabilizer and he goes on a rant, Izzy tells him the Watchers are trying to kill people (and are “stifling innovation”) and god forbid they stifle innovation so Zephyr is on board (he also doesn’t want them killing Izzy); she also asks the good doctor for his zombies so we have an army</li>
<li>Nicholas is in a snowglobe with Will that I pocket, and I walk to the CTE; its the Sentinel who is in charge, and I try convincing him I was sent by Larry to deliver secret shit; as they page him to confirm me, I blip to the CTE (-1tp), they shoot tranqs at me but they miss, and get to New Jersey, then San Diego where I meet Izzy (-2 TU) and give her Will Dalton</li>
<li>The others reach the Second Hand base; Riley is in her wheelchair, Izzy is working, Quaid is working as well, Tracker is watching a kung fu show and is trying to imitate the moves; Piglet the Irish kid is running around; Simon appears and Izzy introduces him (Quaid is french and reaches out a left hand); the shipments Izzy was waiting for came in</li>
<li>The SH folks want to talk to the Daltons now, he sends Simon to work with Leo, who I learn is LEONARDO DA FUCKING VINCI; I admonish her and learn that he was brought in from time, and Phoenix argues with her over the timeline being potentially compromised from this</li>
<li>Steven Hawking rolls up to us and tells Phoenix to have faith in the universe; Phoenix argues that they believe in people</li>
<li>Simon asks Mr. Hawking is he’s left handed</li>
<li>Ada Lovelace, the first programmer, is also here; Enigma buries her head in her hands at this breach of protocol and Izzy insists it was SH who did it and she didn’t even know (though right now she is in charge)</li>
<li>Hans Rubric is also here I’m gonna lose it</li>
<li>I learn Rosemary and Sidney got high as fuck and something about a snail being the secret of the universe</li>
<li>We release Cecilia, and Rosemary tries to talk to her; she shows her a powerpoint and rolls a 16 to convince her that Orlaith was being possessed to kill her, and shows the videos Phoenix got so she can see the threads; Cecilia now knows the Knights weren’t after her, it was the Watchers</li>
<li>Rosemary tells her the world may be ending in less than a day; she convinces Cecilia that the threads were Larry’s work, Cecilia needs a bit more convincing on the world ending, and tells Rosemary to take her to the end of the world, Phoenix, Juniper and Simon accompany them; she sees the moon existing as floating chunks and the world being a wasteland (New New York is where they go); she sees the WatchTower being replaced with the aftermath fallout of a purple explosion; there is no life here</li>
<li>Rosemary convinces Cecilia, and she asks why they don’t just work with Zephyr and Lightborn instead of working with terrorists, the ones who killed Jeremy Dalton… Juniper and Phoenix clear the misinfo, it was Larry. It was the Watchers… Cecilia is on our side and will try to convince Will, though she’s convinced she won’t work with the SH</li>
<li>The invisibility tech can detect outlines but exact details; I argue with Izzy about going to teleport Tuhorn but Izzy is extremely stern, I am not going (besides, she needs me at full TU for the final plan she has…); I give Sidney my spare energy gun, I tell her it was a gift so be careful with it; I give Magpie my physical gun and say it wasn’t a gift but she should be careful with it anyway cause its a gun and she needs that</li>
<li>Izzy goes over plans; regular Watchers will be but we are not to kill them, they will be pumped with toxins and teleported to Izzy’s zombies, downed, and teleported to a safe place where they will be stabilized and out of our way; drones will teleport them in the first room (Hall of the Dead, first room); me and Magpie in the Second Room will be waiting and I need to get</li>
<li>first room hall of the dead, second room is toxic room, I need to be prepared to get Magpie out with tp</li>
<li>Third room has drones that look like us to hopefully fool someone from a distance; they are manually controlled and detonated (we question how she got all this shit, she says she’s Chrono-Co’s little baby and I hide a laugh); i’m critical here, I need to tp in and out to transport people, our people will be here controlling the drones and when the Watchers come in, I bring our people out so the Watchers are trapped in the room</li>
<li>Project Warlord is the final room, MacIntyre will be there to my surprise; Warlord is Izzy’s passion project, it will help us fight and will suppress people being able to use TU (our enemies); she got the tech from some of the shit the Watchers were up to, they’re suppressors and Rosemary will be operating the button; if anyone goes down Rosemary will turn it off so I can tp, there may be a bit of a delay in when its turned on and off</li>
<li>If Watcher leadership doesn’t fall for the bait, we finish the stabilizers; they HAVE to come here to stop us</li>
<li>12 days here is one day on the outside</li>
<li>I bring up that the Lone Master lives on the dark side of the moon in his mansion, and he may attempt to interrupt us from wherever he is (especially with Marlow working with his); I tell the group (Izzy, Juniper and Phoenix) that Marlow and I were part of a secret operatives unit together organized by Larry and Lone Master, it was top secret and it was for taking down Hemlock; Lone Master may be the third Watcher Loyalist, though he could also be part of Marlow’s unit and is actually staging a coup with the Whisperer being the third member (I feel he is a Loyalist)</li>
<li>We plan, realize that me with one turn to tp and possibly going near Larry is a death sentence but maybe Phoenix can tank it so I can separate Larry from everyone else (though we’d need suppressors to be up so I can do things, and Jane needs to be de-wanded so she can’t bring people out)</li>
<li>Miri’s kaleidoscope can be used to see if anyone is disguised (Jane’s ability)</li>
<li>I am given my TU back by Izzy and have 9 now</li>
<li>The others return with Tuhorn in a snowglobe; success</li>
<li>We get word that the Watchers are storming the building…</li>
<li>The first room will have none of us, second room will have me, Magpie and Sidney holding them off; once the Watchers get close enough, I tp me and Sid to another room behind room 4 where the others are and Magpie falls back to room 3; room 3 will have Magpie, Simon, Juniper and Phoenix (+Riley) who will fall back to room 4 when their portion is over, they’re gonna detonate the area; Tuhorn, Tracker and MacIntyre will be in room 4 (room 5 behind room 4 is a decoy room, the room branching off that is where we will all be, me, Izzy, Dr. Rain, Damien, Zephyr, Quaid)</li>
<li>A radio crackles and Jane contacts Izzy; she asks Izzy to surrender but its more of a legal practice, Jane is clearly coming in; she tries telling Izzy we have 10 years left of life if Izzy walks away, but Izzy says the same and its clear the two will not budge</li>
<li>Riley is in a receptacle and the SH are ready to go</li>
<li>A Knight warship shows up and calls for Magpie’s arrest; MacIntyre looks confused, they think Magpie killed Orlaith; Glasg is here, Clinton is missing, Thorwald and H are here; we get MacIntyre to try and talk to them (the Knights are with the Watchers); Izzy broadcasts the footage of Marlow admitting to wanting to disable the Knights council, and Tracker goes on the intercom to tell the Knights it wasn’t the SH but Watchers, they think its doctored but if they see Tracker then maybe they’ll be convinced</li>
<li>The Knights don’t fully back off, and Izzy makes it clear if they enter they die; we can’t let the world end; before Jane comes in I turn to Izzy and am about to say what I wish if we die, but then i shake my head and with a determined look say we will survive</li>
<li>Jane enters the compound and sees a hoard of zombies coming for her; we see Phantom of the Disco’s corpse (he’s one of the ones Zephyr got from the ball)</li>
<li>Some of the zombies are speaking and groaning “fuck you” at Jane Doe; they’re robo and Jane slices through some of the zombies with ease; Izzy gets a critical hit on Jane from a zombie</li>
<li>Larry uses his threads and tears through the zombies; he gives Jane a healing buff</li>
<li>Marlow is clearing the room of zombies with massive firepower; he lays flares and Watchers storm in</li>
<li>Juniper and I ready and wait; Izzy’s turn, she positions normal zombies, special zombies and other such goons; just as one of the Elite guards is about to have a jugular slit, Izzy’s drone comes in and teleports him</li>
<li>Marlow attacks the robots and Damien’s new pacifist buff nullifies it a bit, Phantom is in this first room; Marlow obliterates out zombies</li>
<li>The Lone Master comes up in a sort of opera get up and opens a book; he buffs the Watcher forces by letting them see a little into the future (.1 seconds) and it gives them insight</li>
<li>Paladin Glasg has been instructed to wait, and is now being off by Marlow but Glasg doesn’t listen to Marlow</li>
<li>Phantom apparently canonically went to hell (or he thinks he does); he retreats behind the second door but not before leaving a little disco present… (a groove grenade); it stuns everyone and forces them to dance (instead Marlow and one elite guard)</li>
<li>Jane is apparently draining certain individuals to drain them for energy</li>
<li>Marlow blankets the room so Phantom’s attack is null (its line of sight operated)</li>
<li>The door to room 2 opens, Phantom ran out of the way while Dancing Fever was busy; gas oozes out of Room 2, the Watchers put on gas masks, and Magpie shoots out at Marlow and would’ve downed him but a guard jumps in front of him so he’s at 2hp; he gets a Nat 12 character check</li>
<li>Sidney gets attacked and Tuhorn tanks some of the damage with a wall of vines; he uses his action and Marlow is wrapped up in vines</li>
<li>We finally learn that Marlow is canonically 57 years old; he has a cane cause of the war</li>
<li>Izzy continues to take on guards; I need to get Phantom a disco blunt from Cecilia</li>
<li>Demolitionists are attempting to get to room 3, Izzy’s spiders and other woodland creatures are fighting; the spiders swarm Marlow, and Marlow orders that the guards torch them to get the spiders; Glasg runs in and is preparing to join the fight</li>
<li>Sidney drugs everyone in the room (2 medics, some guards); one medic is stunned, another is scared; Tuhorn; Marlow covers his ears as Tuhorn says a whimsical line before turning a medic into a flower (he wasn’t here when we had the briefing to not kill); Marlow counterspells so flower medic is good</li>
<li>Sidney and Tuhorn are injured, and that’s my cue; I put one hand on Tuhorn’s shoulder, one on Sidney’s and do what I do best… disappear. -6 charges cause its more than 30 feet</li>
<li>Phantom runs to room 3; Jane Doe stares down a platypus and the platypus needs to make a character save; she gets jellyfish’d; we have a couple snakes next and Larry executes them</li>
<li>Marlow gets torched and takes some damage; I take a -1 charge to get to Cecilia and a disco blunt</li>
<li>Magpie is invisible and shoots at Marlow; he attempts to parry but fails (he’s knocked); Izzy tries to tp Marlow but Lone Master prevents it…</li>
<li>I get the blunt and come back to room 3 (-1 tp) an give Phantom his fucking disco blunt</li>
<li>I tell Izzy I’m going back in, she says to not die; I say someone needs to keep her from overworking, and she says she doesn’t need another reason for revenge (flosh)</li>
<li>Piglet fires a rocket down the hall and hits a Watcher, Marlow does a thing so visible light is obscured but infrared light is seeable; he can see some traps, including the quick sand Sidney laid out and avoids it</li>
<li>Lone Master who we can’t quite see is doing some shit; our room 3 squad is readying and Phantom with the blunt has been revived and has his full abilities back; we get +2 to all actions; the whole floor will light up with disco shit and blow up when Phantom is given the cue by Izzy</li>
<li>The Watchers go towards room 3 where we are fucking ready; they split a little bit and Izzy deploys the robo-decoys of her and I; her robo explodes on them and wipes out the squad that were heading down the other hall; Jane readies something…</li>
<li>Larry sticks 5 threads into Jane and says “go get em!” before she gets exploded by “Breacher”, Phoenix delivers a huge blow to her and Larry takes all his threads out (6 total, there was one in her before)</li>
<li>Magpie shoots at Jane and without Larry’s threads Jane is significantly damaged (below half health)</li>
<li>Phoenix takes a shit ton of damage but they are resistant to a lot; Jane teleports behind Larry (someone gave her an ability, probably Lone Master)</li>
<li>I see Larry come in, and he says “oh Enigma good to see you”; I shoot him with energy and do damn good rolls with my Fuck Larry Morton buff and my Phantom +2 buff before saying “good to see you too sir”; he doesn’t seem to take too much injury as his thread that failed to strike me (missed by AC by one) turns around and seems to look like a doctor that merges with him; he heals</li>
<li>Izzy has some of her androids sprint at Larry but he slices them down; he flips over an explosion though does take some damage</li>
<li>Marlow is trying to blow open the door to Room 3, and Jane gets healed by a medic ; goons protect Larry</li>
<li>Sidney does a readied action and drugs the shit out of the guards</li>
<li>Lone Master is buffing and cursing people; we all see a horrible vision of all of us disintegrating, -10 mental damage; Sidney is downed and Phoenix tells her to get the hell back up with an ability that ups her with 1hp and being next in initiative; they also go to attack his watch, hits, and the doctor thread is gone; Larry frowns, then smiles and says “nice move, you’re dead”; Phoenix runs away</li>
<li>Tuhorn shouts a rhyme about turning everyone into rubble and the ceiling collapses on all but one of the guards; the demolitionists blast open one of the doors to Room 3; Marlow’s squad goes to torch as many as possible when Glasg says go; we all roll above 10 to avoid getting fire damage (except Damien; -5 for everyone but i am energy resistance so I take -2)</li>
<li>Tracker comes out and takes care of Glasg, lets goooooo</li>
<li>Dr. Rain has an ability that confuses and distracts the enemies; she stops time and casts an angry Homer Simpson (might not be canon) towards Marlow (its Riley/The Guy and some unknown bruiser Marlow met in Egypt in receptacles) and sicks em on Marlow; Spot and Riley attack the flamers</li>
<li>Phantom triggers his readied Disco Inferno and Groove Grenade, and everyone but Larry gets blown tf up (Larry has moves so he’s fine, he can dance); I am also hit with the groove and am stunned</li>
<li>Simon kills one of their medic. Medic on medic violence. There can be only one.</li>
<li>Jane Doe is angered and attacks me; I am slowed by her ability (-2 AC, half movement speed, disadvantage on everything); Juniper fails to shoot her; she attacks me and I take so much fucking damage and am downed; Jane puts a sword up to me and says she’ll kill me if Izzy doesn’t open the door; Izzy opens the Room 4 door despite me pleading with Izzy not to; she drops me to the floor and attacks Phoenix and Juniper protects so she’s not downed</li>
<li>Larry needs to change his fighting style and a spectral image of a marionette appears behind him and phases into him; he puts 2 threads into Jane and she floats over to him</li>
<li>A thread goes into Juniper but she resists, and Magpie shoots his watch with mental energy; the marionette image fizzles, the thread is still in Juniper but its very weak</li>
<li>Juniper readies a forcefield and is ready to put it up at Piglet’s command</li>
<li>With my ability despite being downed I am able to run and fall back; Magpie gets a critical on the watch but it does nothing because he doesn’t have threads out</li>
<li>MacIntyre runs in from Room 4 and gives a retreat order; Izzy stims me up and I’m stable (+8); Piglet shouts “fire in the hole”, the explosion fro Room 3 goes off</li>
<li>We get a +1 to any one damage type and resistance in Room 4; the rest of Izzy’s bots flood in as MacIntyre goes back to 4</li>
<li>An energy forcefield stand between us and Marlow; he puts anti-receptacle gear on Riley so they get attacked (she’s somehow not downed with how much Marlow demolished her)</li>
<li>Izzy’s robots were designed so even when they get down, they turn into field mines and the bombs in them wait for detonation; what a genius</li>
<li>Juniper and Phoenix are downed; Tuhorn makes a thornwall and holds his position, saying its been fun but his job is done… a sacrifice. Without him, we will need to rebuild the Watchers on our own</li>
<li>Simon stims Phoenix and carries Juniper out (she’s still down but is being moved); Jane Doe is slashing at the wall, and Larry has a new spectral figure of a child, he shoots a thread at Phoenix and Tuhorn; Damien tanks it in Phoenix’s stead; I run into Room 3 for the final time and tp Phoenix to Room 4 (-2 charges); I hate that i can’t be there to save Riley and Tuhorn with tp, but Izzy’s orders are to fall back, and I listen</li>
<li>Piglet retreats, Izzy’s bots swarm Marlow, and “Izzy” walks up to him and explodes him, downing him</li>
<li>Izzy’s proximity mines detonate, Riley is still in the room and can’t un-receptacle; she says its been an honor, and her real body lays still and doesn’t wake up</li>
<li>Marlow isn’t able to stay up, and a dog rips into his throat… Marlow MacPherson is dead</li>
<li>Simon ups Juniper; we ready in Room 4, Izzy has something up her sleeve</li>
<li>On the other side of the door, Jane Doe says this is our last chance… Izzy says they both know the answer to that</li>
<li>MacIntyre tries speaking to the Knights that are beside Jane (she says they’re doctored, obviously); the Knights are mixed, and MacIntyre says they shouldn’t die fighting this fight; I make a speech that his words are true, I worked with both Watchers and Knights, saying I’ve seen what both are doing and the Watchers they are fighting with are the enemy, they shouldn’t die for this (I GET A NAT 12 CHARACTER LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO)</li>
<li>As one complains that they need Glasg’s order, Tracker chimes in saying “I think Glasg would want you to shut the fuck up” before having Glasg back from the shadow dimension, and the Knights leave</li>
<li>Larry says the Knights are right, and he says he’s leaving; Jane admonishes him, but he says “sorry, end of the world calls” and leaves Jane; she refuses to leave, and she will fight us solo (though Lone Master is still here)</li>
<li>Quaid is almost done with the stabilizers; its just us vs Jane and Lone Master</li>
<li>The people in the front take damage and Juniper and Sidney gets downed; we are now in a place that doesn’t allow for watch abilities (the suppressors are up)</li>
<li>Jane runs in and beats the shit out of Simon (ouch); she uses some ability that buffs them before she runs into the anti-field; she downs Simon</li>
<li>I shoot at the guards but don’t deliver much damage</li>
<li>Izzy activates Project Warlord, giving a ton of effects and hitting Jane with a giant fucking mech suit</li>
<li>Magpie goes to get the guard and downs him; Izzy ups Simon</li>
<li>Phoenix ups Juniper, and attacks Jane but misses; Lone Master gets attacked by Juniper and is kinda fucked up</li>
<li>Nicholas pokeballs Sidney to safety (she’ll be upped in there)</li>
<li>Lone Master does some form of a bomb attack and I take -10 mental damage; I’m downed as is Magpie, and Jane rushes me; Simon and Phoenix rush to protect action me; Jane goes to swing into me three times and Izzy tanks two hits, while Phantom tanks the last one (he’s downed)</li>
<li>Downed I try to shoot at Lone Master, i’m able to seriously wound him to 1 hit; Izzy attacks him and kills him (he’s torn to shreds by temporal fischers)</li>
<li>Jane Doe is getting more furious by the second; Simon stims me and i’m at 1hp</li>
<li>Izzy mortally wounds her; Magpie takes the shot… she gets hit in the stomach, falls to the floor and is dying; she looks up at Izzy with a sort of sadness, and says “for both of our sakes, I hope it works”&hellip; Izzy says thank you Jane.</li>
<li>I walk up to Jane and put my gun up to her head, but look over at Magpie and wait… she walk up, puts her gun, and a single round is heard (the second shot is silent…)</li>
<li>Morgana has been avenged</li>
<li>izzy fails to stabilize the stabilizer, but Leonardo da Vinci and Zephyr point out some kinks; the stabilizer almost failed… but it worked. It fucking worked</li>
<li>Izzy is group hugging her scientists and crying</li>
<li>We hear a knock and Tracker and returns after leaving with the Knights earlier</li>
<li>Izzy turns around and hugs me; people are watching so I freeze up, but I use my obscured arm to hug her back; Quaid sees it and starts making loud remarks that end in me being a sack of bricks (Izzy says I’m her sack of brick and I say her name in furious embarrassment); I threaten to shoot Quaid</li>
<li>I go to Marlow’s body, and Izzy helps me bury it (I do it Watcher style)</li>
<li>I learn ooc that my high character roll with the Knights is the reason all of them left and Larry decided to bail from the scales being in our favor… I’m the reason he left (I also realize at some point he kills people and steals their souls)
OBJECTIVES: Bury Marlow; give Magpie the rest of the credits; get concrete evidence of the Watcher Loyalists’ plans to expose them (encryption of Jane’s message on assassinating Thorwald? And have Nicholas do the same for his message from Larry; snoop around the Archives for info on how to take down Larry; Holly Holland?); plan Larry Morton’s downfall; break out Brad; hit up other Watcher counselors to establish the new leadership; talk to Breacher</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-finale-part-ii-stopping-a-war-sun-721">The Finale Part II: Stopping A War (Sun 7/21)</h1>
<ul>
<li>Watchers (esp Whisperer whose status is unknown) is very hostile with the Minutemen (Selene killed Tasha, and they know we killed Alek); Thorwald wants to detain the MM w/ Whisperer; Watchers and Chrono-Co we need details on; Chrono-Co and Knights are tense, Dr. Lightborn is preparing for conflict (CC think Knights tried to kill Cecilia), Chrono-Co and Minutemen are chill</li>
<li>We are low on time fluid, its all being used for the stabilizer (Simon blew up the rest that one time)</li>
<li>We start with Rosemary; Leonardo da Vinci and the other historicals are bidding their farewell, gunfire goes off in the background; she prepares to speak with John Time so they can convince Will Dalton to not have Chrono-Co go to war</li>
<li>I give 3 TU to Izzy</li>
<li>Izzy is hesitant to have John Time here, tensions are hot and we’re compromised; Rosemary, Cecilia, Simon and Magpie (invisible) travel through the CTE to get to him and deal with Chrono-Co tensions to stop the war</li>
<li>Eventually we’ll need a way to get back to the WatchTower, CTE is taken over by the Sentinel/Watchers (HGDF, Marlow loyalists) and Miri’s mansion basement is taken over</li>
<li>Rosemary and the group enter and upon the Sentinel seeing them, Cecilia thanks Rosemary for saving her and hugs her (she’s trying to play the part and whispers to Rosemary to hug her back or the Sentinel won’t buy it); Rosemary is blushing so hard and is a bit stiff but hugs back for the cover</li>
<li>Sentinel questions their temporal readings, and asks where they came from; they say Montana (the jump point before the base) and believe it from SImon reeking of alcohol and confusion</li>
<li>John Time is in his corporate office, coping with the end of the world by working; Rosemary brings her squad to him and he warmly welcomes them, saying that Chrono-Co is somewhat unstable right now with Dalton being gone (SImon aids his fridge)</li>
<li>She gives him the rundown, we sort of kidnapped Will Dalton and need to convince him to stop the war (John Time apparently tried to mind control the Chrono-Co boss to end the war and it didn’t go well lmao); he’s on board</li>
<li>Paradox in Time’s head pipes up, and talks to Time about being the voice of Chrono-Co by killing Will… Time resists this</li>
<li>Dalton is let out and goes on a rant about Chrono-crisps before becoming stressed about what the actual shit is going on; apparently Will is the one who Time tried to mindwash so he’s asking why he shouldn’t just call security</li>
<li>Time says what he told Will at the ball was true, the Watchers are trying to end the world; Cecilia vouches for this, and clears up that Orlaith trying to kill her was Larry’s work; Will says if Larry wants a war, Chrono-Co will give him one, but Time and Rosemary say that the war is what he wants, they need to <em>prevent</em> a war</li>
<li>Dalton realizes the end of the world, which would happen if a war were to happen, would be terrible for profits (only rats would be around to buy Chrono-Co goods and services), and he is on the side of preventing the war</li>
<li>Will tells Rosemary and Time to get the non-Loyalist Watchers on our side, and that Larry needs to go; we also need a Knights connection (through Simon and Tracker); we also need a Minuteman… (Breacher but Bryce WASN’T FUCKING HERE)</li>
<li>Dalton gives them details, Regino Cho is at odds with Widgeon Giles of the Watchers, she doesn’t work with Larry but she’s not happy with Chrono-Co; Paladin Glasg is <em>pissed</em> at the Watchers and is planning to maybe storm Watcher HQ (he hates Larry but doesn’t trust the whole faction); Whisperer has been anti-Minutemen for a while (MM district is under his control)</li>
<li>Tracker and MacIntyre will deal with Glasg and the Knights, he throws out that the Eyes Unseen could convince Sentinel to let us through… Dalton’s able to get the non-Watchers through the Sentinel</li>
<li>I contact Eyes Unseen to have him deal with the Sentinel (who’s now taking orders from Larry since Marlow’s dead); Eyes does Nat12 god roll and gets Sentinel to leave to deal with things elsewhere while he controls the CTE</li>
<li>We jump in -1 TU and bid Eyes’ drone adieu before heading off</li>
<li>Chronicler articles state that Madame E is missing and Marlow is dead; Eyes, Whisperer and Larry are the only Watcher Counselors left</li>
<li>Rosemary and Izzy apparently knew Widgeon, and as a Watcher who’s sort of dealt with her before I’m coming
*Whisperer/Minutemen: Phoenix, Juniper, Phantom/Damien, Magpie, Dr. Rain
*Widgeon/Regina Cho: Enigma, Izzy, Rosemary, John Time, Simon
*Knights vs Larry: Tracker, MacIntyre, Eyes has eyes on it, rest of us when we&rsquo;re done</li>
<li>Phantom gave Cecilia a groove grenade for some reason</li>
<li>Eyes’ drone follows us, I am aware of it</li>
<li>We are at an automaton factory, one of the ones from the old days; my squad sees Regina Cho’s Aggressive Acquisition Division armed and holding the fort, and Widgeon Gyles with military Watchers (some are HGDF) is standing ready for conflict; Gyles wants to talk to Cho</li>
<li>Rosemary walks up to Gyles and says its been a while, this isn’t the best time for reunions but they need to talk; Gyles says this isn’t a good time, Rosemary isn’t safe here and should leave (or talk to Regina); Chrono-Co can’t get away with what they’re doing, Rachel, Holly, everything</li>
<li>I pipe up that Gyles doesn’t understand everything that’s going on, and Rosemary isn’t naive; she should be listened to</li>
<li>Gyles pulls a gun on me and says there are orders for my arrest, she asks me why I would betray the Watchers for the Second Hand, the Knights, Chrono-Co…</li>
<li>Rosemary tells her that the world is ending, and we have the tech to prevent that; she says Larry showed footage that shows he destroyed our tech, and Izzy asks for sais evidence</li>
<li>Gyles says she doesn’t know what to trust, everything’s doctored and everyone says everything; she can only trust what she says</li>
<li>Rosemary talks to Regina (without me, Gyles wants me staying with her), tries to make it so Watchers have a bit of oversight to keep the peace, using Dalton’s credibility to help; Regina says she can allow for oversight, but not from a Watcher (definitely not Gyles)</li>
<li>Rosemary vibe checks Gyles from a distance, and can tell Regina is confident while Gyles has a bit of doubt</li>
<li>Rosemary tries to get her to believe, and I ask Gyles about how she believes in what she sees, she’s seen me put my life on the line time and time again for the timeline and Watch Tower, I wouldn’t betray the Watchers to destroy it all (i roll a 14 :D); she’s convinced</li>
<li>Gyles tells Rosemary she doesn’t trust Regina, and Regina shouldn’t be allowed full control; we convince her Mr. Time is reliable right now, and we’ll have Minutemen take over when we have stability (she doesn’t want Chrono-Co to have control forever, but she can accept these terms for now)</li>
<li>Regina, Holly and Rachel all have histories of being in their own bubble within Chrono-Co, so Mr. Time and Rosemary give their pitches (bribery and bartering, obviously); they’re able to barter that Regina gets the credit for diffusing this conflict (my recommendation) and 7.5% profits from what this factory will produce under the Minutemen, and she agrees</li>
<li>Widgeon and Regina agree to these terms, and depart</li>
<li>Gyles calls off her squad, and her people leave but some HGTF Watchers are refusing to leave; she orders them to disperse and they remain; she has her Watchers pull them away, no fighting but she glances at me and says “I see what you mean”</li>
<li>Gyles tells me with how much our faction has fallen apart, we might not even have Watchers, I say maybe not, but if we do we will need good Watchers like her to be strong (she bids me and Rosemary goodbye, she didn’t respond to me, but she got the message)</li>
<li>Mr. Time will hold down the fort, he will sell this compound to Minutemen when its stable enough for negotiations; redemption arc complete</li>
<li>Simon canonically drunk the entire time because we all forgot he was with us</li>
<li>The second squad enters the Minutemen district and feels a weird mind-numbing sensation; everything is red, and Juniper knows this is mind-numbing tech; Dr. Rain can’t discern where its coming from</li>
<li>They message me to message Eyes, who is aiding them via drone
*Whisperer Mind-numbing tech is active, suppressing
*Lylan (important minuteman NPC, Alec&rsquo;s second?) is talking to a Watcher in front of the door
*Miri&rsquo;s manor has been taken over the council, not just Watchers</li>
<li>Whisperer should be in the insurance office, they plan to talk with Lylan first since this group has mostly Minutemen (Breacher, Phantom, Magpie)</li>
<li>Dr. Rain apparently knows Lylan; Phantom talks to her to try and convince her that the Watchers might stand down if the Minutemen let them go (they care about their pride)</li>
<li>Some MM have been off-table negotiating with Watchers for selfish reasons, while others have been looking for alternative ways to resolve the conflict… not god ways</li>
<li>Breacher got lost to Jane Doe, I killed Wilde which is public news now (“Phoenix” definitely knows now…), Tasha was taken by Selene; MM leadership is in shambles because of Watchers</li>
<li>Eyes comes in through drone and brings Phoenix with them through the compound to speak with Whisperer (success character check); the others need to stay back</li>
<li>Juniper can tell the Whisperer is the one using the mind-numbing tech, they have a sort of regal yet cultish-looking cloak</li>
<li>Whisperer says its good to see Eyes, even if they never see Eyes’ face (Whisperer also doesn’t show their face, its obscured by an illusion of a black cloud)</li>
<li>Phoenix tells Whisperer to their face that they fucked up and need to leave this area; Whisperer says the WatchTower can only healthily function if the MM aren’t in control</li>
<li>Whisperer doesn’t seem to be in the armageddon squad, he just hates MM controlling this district; Larry told them everything would be fine and trusted him to know what was best for the timeline (he’s the Archivist); Phoenix tells Whisp Larry is an insane psychopath</li>
<li>Eyes pipes up that Larry without Jane Doe to wrangle him in is dangerous; Whisp is… listening. Though they need assurance that if the Watchers leave this district MM wouldn’t attack them</li>
<li>”Phoenix” is full of fire and won’t be polite, but she does appeal to Whisperer that Larry can’t be trusted and the Watchers need to leave this office; she agrees and departs, though some Watchers will remain in the area (MM will have the control, Watchers will just be around)</li>
<li>Phoenix and co will now need to convince the MM to accept this deal</li>
<li>Phantom walks up to one of the MM (Dan Manning?) and everyone gets questioned (Phantom, Dr. Rain, Magpie, Juniper); Dr. Rain also somehow knows this guy and says something that puts them in a bad spot… Breacher says fuck this and reveals herself. Breacher is fucking back</li>
<li>Manning is skeptical since Breacher died but she convinces him (Receptacle, and she knows who Alek’s daughter’s name is)</li>
<li>Phantom tries appealing to Manning about them going drinking (Dan doesn’t remember cause he was drunk, though he does remember Simon who he says might have legally flammable blood from all the alcohol)</li>
<li>Manning believes Breacher, and they’ll stand down when the Watchers leave, and temporarily accept some of them staying here (they can hold it off until we handle the main Watcher conflicts)</li>
<li>The Whisperer moves out, taking the mind number with them</li>
<li>We meet up; things are going well; Tracker has returned, MacIntyre is negotiating the last bits of the deal (Chrono-Co and Knights have made peace, the Watchers are confused and split with Loyalists and regular Watchers)</li>
<li>We meet up, and Phoenix pulls a sword at me asking what the fuck I did to Alec; I ask Izzy if she trusts Phoenix and Izzy says yes, so I explain (i keep jett’s name a secret, but Phoenix knows somehow…)</li>
<li>She is furious, and says she expected this from Jett but not me… I am confused and asking why this random Knight cares so much about Alek, and why Phantom is doing interpretive dances behind her (he was trying to tell me it was Breacher)</li>
<li>Phoenix tells me she thought I was smart, and takes off her glasses; gray eyes stare back at me… I recognize those eyes… its Breacher.</li>
<li>i’m confused, but accepting the reality; I have the same face I did when we last met, longing, fear and a bit of hope; she’s furious about Alec and I tell her I killed him before we got to her</li>
<li>She says she had hope in me but was wrong to after I killed Alec. She says it would have been better if I had stayed dead</li>
<li>Glasg is about to storm the Watcher HQ and we need to hold; I walk up to breacher, keeping a distance, and reach out my arm before pulling back; her arms are crossed and she’s glaring off into space</li>
<li>Glasg storms in, and Izzy desperately tries to appeal to him; we convince him to give us 5 minutes; I snap out of it and go to give a speech to make the Watchers stand down</li>
<li>I get a megaphone and tell Watchers to stand down, the faction is crippled and they are under the orders of someone who wants to destroy the world; Larry hits back that traitor scum like me can’t be trusted; I hit back that he intended to live on in the Hemlock base while everyone else dies so what kind of scum does that make him?</li>
<li>A sniper shoots at me and Starlight tanks it; we failed (low rolls), and the Knights storm and clash with Watchers (though my words did seem to persuade some of the regulars)</li>
<li>I say to not hurt the Watchers, if you must target the HDTF; aim for Larry’s watch (Simon says didn’t I get hit by them, and I say yes many times so aim for the damn watch)</li>
<li>We rush through Watcher HQ, some of the Watchers are not fighting and mostly HGTF and Whisperer Watchers are still fighting</li>
<li>Larry is on Level 6, Simulacrum Room</li>
<li>We rush down, and find the void room (it looks like a void); in the darkness, Larry’s voice chimes in, my Knights have caused quite the fuss but he’s got a wild ride planned</li>
<li>Eyes informs me Whisperer is on Larry’s side (I failed to convince him)</li>
<li>Juniper can tell this room is full of tech that can create illusions and alter the environment</li>
<li>There are 6 crates, something Izzy is dreading (they have people in it?)</li>
<li>Breacher says fuck it and runs in, so we all follow</li>
<li>Larry and Whisp take a stance, and the threads are in the crates; they start to rise</li>
<li>We need to figure out what he’s vulnerable to in the moment to know how to attack him best</li>
<li>Larry shoots threads at me first (of course he does), he has disadvantage cause of my Fuck Larry Morton ability; he misses most but one goes in me and I get -8 damage, I feel a strange pull and fail to fight him so I lose a TU that goes into him, a prison Warden spectral form comes from him and its hard for me to move…</li>
<li>Rosemary tries to hit Larry with mental damage but it doesn’t do much</li>
<li>Whisperer looks towards me and attacks, whispering that I am nothing and showing me a flashback of my parents disintegrating… (-9 mental damage) and I’m frightened so I get disadvantage on attacks (my FLM ability is nullified so its just flat rolls against him)</li>
<li>Simon hits the Whisperer with some damage</li>
<li>I am able to use my ability to rip Larry’s thread out of me; Larry’s turn now</li>
<li>The scene around Simon shifts, he’s at the Drunken Duckling but he’s inside a barrel keg; he creates more and takes cover</li>
<li>One of the crates bursts open and Orlaith is being strung by threads and puppetted; she attacks Simon</li>
<li>Juniper can tell that Larry is currently vulnerable to energy, Whisperer is either physical or mental</li>
<li>Juniper tries taking on Whisperer and gets downed, Phoenix tanks some damage so she’s not too low on saves</li>
<li>Phantom uses Disco Never Dies to give us all +2 and makes everyone dance</li>
<li>”The drone flies over to Enigma and dispenses a raspberry white chocolate cookie. &ldquo;Courtesy of Agent Aurora. Bon Apetit.&rdquo; Then she can eat it on her turn as a free action.”</li>
<li>I get a fucking 14 on dancing and do some sick ass moves; Samba specificaly :]</li>
<li>Phoenix brings back Juniper with her res ability; she says fuck Larry Morton and charges with a fire sword (i shout at her to wait but she doesn’t listen); she hits his watch with energy and severs a thread, one of the zombies from the crate goes down (there’s 5)</li>
<li>Larry tries threading her but fails</li>
<li>Sidney drugs three zombies and Simon takes some of the damage (its an AOE)</li>
<li>Eyes does something in the background…</li>
<li>Mr. Time attacks Larry, his thread blocks it but he’s not in a good spot; he then fires the president and gets Richard Nixon, 37th president; President Nixon says “I am not a crook, but you are!” and uses Watergate and water floods over Larry</li>
<li>Izzy fires a lightning bolt and downs the Whisperer before firing at Larry Morton; it succeeds, but he uses a TU and redirects the damage to one of his zombies who goes down</li>
<li>Dr. Rain was able to tamper with the Whisperer’s number but not completely take it down, we get -1 on our rolls</li>
<li>Magpie shoots at Larry, and the damage goes to a zombie; he pulls up the form of a child and is not very quick (he doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks); there’s an acceleration bubble that was put up earlier (gives you double movement? So long as you’re in range) and Larry goes to attack it and Simon</li>
<li>Larry deals a deathly amount of damage (10 ATTACKS) and Rosemary rewinds to bring it down; he’s still downed, and a thread that was in the Whisperer who was downed brings him back up</li>
<li>Rosemary runs over and heals Simon (he’s not up but he’s not on death saves); Whisperer is back up, 3 zombies are around; Larry wants to attack Dr. Rain before he can finish dismantling the machine</li>
<li>Dr. Rain gets the machine working in our favor, we all have +1 now (with Phantom’s +2, +3 total)</li>
<li>Larry attacks and Simon is once again on death saves; those around Larry taking the mental damage of Whisperer’s attacks see Simon being puppeted by Larry and bludgeoned by zombie Orlaith</li>
<li>I eat Nicholas’ cookie and feel shorter, I look at myself and realize I’m Ringle McTingleBum (attacks against me get disadvantage while I’m an elf)</li>
<li>I go to Larry and rip one of his threads out (+3 from friend buffs and whatever I get from Fuck Larry Morton); I can’t control it, but its around my watch and he can’t control it either</li>
<li>Orlaith hits me with -13 but Starlight tanks it; I take some damage from Orlaith’s fire (its energy so its reduced to -1 for me)</li>
<li>Juniper is downed, Rosemary takes some damage</li>
<li>Phantom uses Disco Revival to up Simon, as well as the zombies we slayed… though they do have lesser stats now (it swaps stats so your highest is character which zombies don’t use to fight)</li>
<li>Breacher rushes Whisperer and hits the thread connected to them but it doesn’t work; Whisperer is down because of Richard Nixon’s republicanism (Watergate attack)</li>
<li>Juniper eats a cookie given, she’s enraged and has +8 hardiness (-2 to all other checks, but our +3 negates)</li>
<li>Larry has about 10 active threads right now; Juniper sees the child thread is vulnerable to physical damage and she +8 punches him in the watch; the child thread is down</li>
<li>Sidney drugs the Whisperer and she’s down; Larry has 5 threads we need to worry about (the others are in the zombies and such, not an issue)</li>
<li>Izzy gets attacked by Orlaith</li>
<li>Izzy apologized to Orlaith for failing to save her, and guts her with her temporal gauntlet</li>
<li>Magpie attacks Orlaith and downs her; the fire around her however still persists and grows bigger…</li>
<li>Larry doesn’t have a doctor thread anymore (we took it out last time), so he changes form to a judge, and 5 threads come for me (3 attacks); he asks me if I have feelings for Izzy and I am very confused and say “I supposed so?”; I get hit, Izzy gets downed tanking the first one, I take -9 physical on the second, and the third gets tanked by Starlancer which is now downed; Izzy falls out of the mech downed</li>
<li>Rosemary is able to stabilize Izzy (still downed but isn’t on death saves)</li>
<li>Simon doesn’t know the vulnerability of the judge thread but shoots with energy, and we luck out cause energy is the correct one; he has two of these kinds of threads remaining</li>
<li>He says we’re fools, if we save the timeline it will all fall apart anyway; I say we don’t know what will happen, he’s afraid of what will happen, but its worth fighting for; he says bullshit, and I get two 17s to hit and damage (it threads to a zombie who goes down)</li>
<li>i get attacked and Izzy tries to tank it but I don’t let her and am downed</li>
<li>Phantom shatters a groove google; Breacher challenged Larry’s morals and gets another groove google down</li>
<li>Breacher shoots Larry and says we will keep getting up time and time again, and reaches a hand out to me; her ability activates, and I take her hand up</li>
<li>My turn… I say nothing, I rush Larry, tp right in front of him with my gun pointed, and shoot (I GOT A NAT12 TO HIT AND A NAT12 FOR DAMAGE HOLY FUCKING SHIT THIS IS UNREAL)</li>
<li>Larry dissipates into temporal energy, and his threads and watch are left behind… I take them</li>
<li>I apologize to Breacher formally, for all of it, that it was my greatest regret… she says she’s surprised to hear me apologize, didn’t think she’d see the day (Enigma is very awkward about it)</li>
<li>Breacher says it seems i’ve got my head on straight, and asks me if she can see the thread spool, I wouldn’t usually but its Breacher so I relent; she immediately stomps on it so Larry is no more (Izzy wanted to analyze it but oh well)</li>
<li>I go outside and get the Watchers to stand down (most of them at least), and am invited to speak at the Council
~~~~~~~~~~~
Council Meeting</li>
<li>We congregate for a Council meeting; almost all the Watcher Counselors are dead, Eyes is not attending; Rosemary’s presentation is used by Dalton going over the information</li>
<li>We have a time fluid shortage but we’re working through it; Zephyr goes over the stabilizers</li>
<li>Time formally gives his automaton district over to the Minutemen, as agreed</li>
<li>The Minutemen want to be recognized as a formal faction, and Time is on board;</li>
<li>Quaid has been exonerated, Dalton says the Second Hand is on the docket; the Watchers lied about many “second handers” being terrorists and calls for exoneration of Izzy and asks if there’s anyone she wants to exonerate, she says she wants exoneration for me (I was integral from defending the stabilizers from the Watcher excursion, so I am cleared); she clears all of us</li>
<li>Breacher was apparently with SH for like 5 years and is Frieda Alman the leader??? I’m confused as shit but she’s exonerated; she looks like Frieda and switches to the Breacher face, revealing herself</li>
<li>Breacher has her seat, and the Minutemen are a faction</li>
<li>Eyes Unseen appears as the sole Watcher Counselor, and how its fractured; he requests himself to be the Watcher headmaster as the last one left</li>
<li>I am brought up to speak, and say that our faction, should it be allowed to continue, will dedicate our efforts to using stability tech to stabilize temporal faults so timelines need not be eradicated; I worked for this faction my entire life, and have seen what it was and what I hope it will be</li>
<li>Breacher advocates for the importance of the timeline and the Watchers, stating that yes Watchers were bringing about the end of the world, but it was individual Watchers who helped save it (she names me, Sidney, Juniper… Morgana) and Mr. Time advocates as well; the Watchers will continue</li>
<li>The Watchers will remain as a faction, our archives will be more open and made to cooperate more; its a Commission of Causality</li>
<li>Chrono-Co has good chances in the upcoming election, led by Zephyr; they’re more splintered but has power; Enigma runs for Counselor, and Minutemen get more seats (Grasshopper gets a seat… we’ll see how that goes)</li>
