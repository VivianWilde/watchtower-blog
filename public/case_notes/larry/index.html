<ul>
<li>Deadly with a sword cane: x3 attacks, 2d6+6 each</li>
<li>+6 agility and hardiness, insane character, insane-r wis, ?? tech but does that even matter?</li>
<li>Ability to “smite” people back to their original era, including Watchtower agents.</li>
<li>Ability to slow others down in order to speed herself up. So a &ldquo;haste&rdquo; ability of unknown scale, this is worrying.</li>

<h1 id="larry">Larry</h1>
<h2 id="known">Known</h2>
<h3 id="general">General</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rarely takes the field, but deadly when he does</li>
<li>If he&rsquo;s not a field agent, hopefully has low Hardiness and Agility.</li>
<li>Torturer: Probably likes to draw combat out rather than end it quickly</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strategiescombat">Strategies/Combat</h3>
<ul>
<li>Larry was able to see Nicolas, so some kind of &ldquo;see invisibility&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="threads">Threads</h3>
<ul>
<li>It looks like the threads can’t trigger anywhere, Larry needs LOS. There’s also no tracking device, but who’s to say if Larry has some way to track them?</li>
<li>Needles seemed to shoot Enigma with laser focus every time she told a lie. They seem to somehow be truth-detecting</li>
<li>Can drain the life out of their targets or reinvigorate them</li>
<li>Forcing one to age exceptionally fast (if Morton wishes harm): Temporal damage, likely powerful debuff as well</li>
<li>Speed up their perception of time (if Morton wishes to help): Like Simon&rsquo;s acceleration bubble.</li>
<li>NOTE: Don&rsquo;t let him boost Jane, that&rsquo;s how we die.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="counters">Counters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Block him from launching the threads</li>
<li>Juniper can try to screen him off with force fields</li>
<li>Find vulnerabilities and take him down quickly</li>
<li>Cut him off from targets (enemies and allies) and take him out</li>
<li>How do we keep Jane and Marlow off our backs in the meantime? Phoenix can hold off one of them with backup on a good day.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do his threads trace targets? Is it telepathic command (in which case we can limit his ability to target things), or something we can fool like heat signatures?</li>
<li>What do we know about the extent of his immunity to invisibility/holograms?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s his preferred battle strategies/roles? (We can try to deny him this, force him to fight on unfamiliar terms)</li>
<li>Strong and weak stats (so we know what saves to target)</li>
<li>Any major abilities or favorite toys beyond the threads?</li>
<li>Generally, advice on how to take him out or at least stop him from taking us out.</li>
<li>Note: If she says &ldquo;I have plans for that, trust me&rdquo; and refuses to elaborate, or anything like that, I suggest you scream at her &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do everything yourself you moron, you tried that with Morgana and look how that turned out.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<li>See through inconsistencies and anomalies</li>

<li>Some kind of weird anti-receptacle crown, quite possibly has other anti-mind-fuckery effects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="counters-1">Counters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Vulnerable to temporal damage</li>
<li>Firewalls to cut off options</li>
