<ul>
<li>What were the early moves of the war like? That might be hints as to how it started.</li>

<li>He loves Blorbo the dog a cartoon dog, the Clown&#39;s chaos god takes the form of Blorbo. Jesus fuck I hate it here.</li>
<li>Malachai&#39;s daughter died, and he couldn&#39;t save her.</li>

<li>After knight annihilation, watchers or chronoco set off bioweapons.</li>
<li>Bioweapon effect.</li>
<li>&#34;Like eating a chunk of uranium&#34;.</li>
<li>You just die, aren&#39;t erased from the timeline or anything</li>
<li>Speculation: Temporal decay, rapid aging and heat death.</li>
<li>Harmful chrono-dust/??? is in the air and water. Not a disease, didn&#39;t evolve, just created to kill and spread.</li>

<li>Old man reading a book, &#34;Troy&#34;</li>

<li>He speaks coherently!</li>
<li>Observation: Young Tuhorn and young Malachai are both pretty chill.</li>
<li>Does something happen to drive them both insane, or is it just time?</li>
<li>Tasha told him to come here, excuse of &#34;book club&#34;</li>
<li>Tuhorn is searching for the Watchers In Wait</li>
<li>He has a conspiracy board and a found time watch.</li>
<li>The found watch had coordinates set to here and message &#34;come to book club&#34;</li>
<li>The watch was mailed to him in the 80s</li>
<li>So Tasha left it for him.</li>

The Watch

<ul>
<li>Sent to him in the mail.</li>
<li>Tuhorn&#39;s conspiracy: Uncovering watcher intervention throughout history, tracking down the Watchers</li>
<li>Dinosaur skeleton that has a ring in it.</li>
<li>Pompeii: Petrified corpse, with lithium (battery) and other minerals near it.</li>
<li>TODO: We need to use Tuhorn to trace the remaining book club members, specifically the one in Pompeii he mentioned</li>
<li>TODO: The Watch itself. Is it perhaps from a stolen shipment or something? Who could have potentially given it to him?</li>
<li>This is after he&#39;s found the watchers but before joining them.</li>
<li>There are some reviews from the 80s on Time Goodreads, so 80s Tuhorn.</li>
<li>Book club: Tasha, Tuhorn, a probably-secondhander in Pompeii, and an unknown probably-Hemlocker.</li>
<li>This watch is the first instance of Watchtower reaching out to young Tuhorn.</li>
<li>Question: When on Tasha&#39;s end did this reaching out occur. Was it Tasha? Was it one of us? Was it future Tuhorn.</li>

COMMENT Speculation
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>Speculation: &#34;You hid it&#34; could either be Watchers, or &#34;you&#34; as in a future Selene? Hard to tell, but likely the former.</li>
<li>Implication: Selene was put onto this trail by someone else.</li>
<li>So, someone sent Tuhorn here.  Someone also sent Selene here. Tasha sent the secondhand here.</li>
<li>Tasha needed a Watcher to discover this place. So a watcher was helping Tasha before Tasha was involved.</li>
<li>The big question is the unclosed part of this catch 22. So Tasha needed a Watcher to start chasing this down. And we know that &#34;Selene should know, she&#39;s told me so much&#34; from the journal.</li>
<li>So Selene was feeding Tasha info, this suggests somehow</li>
<li>So Tasha is the center of all this.</li>
<li>But Selene or Madame E is perhaps the prime mover? Or at least one step &#34;before&#34; Tasha in the weird loop. We need to figure out the digraph of how people spread this knowledge (or hints to it) with each other.</li>

<li>Is Malachai just Ice King from adventure time?</li>
<li>Did Malachai have a turning point into his insanity, or was it a slow decline. Either way, what contributed? Any outside interventions?</li>
<li>Observation: Young Tuhorn and young Malachai are both pretty chill.</li>
<li>Does something happen to drive them both insane, or is it just time?</li>
<li>The animal Malachai needs to synthesise a general cure - a mission to recover that? [Update: Sidney has this info]</li>

<li>Conjecture: &#34;Council business&#34;. Perhaps related to timeline research?</li>

<li>Ok. Vital knight warplans, and intelligence/spy placement details, and something else Jane refuses to tell me and Breacher doesn&#39;t know.</li>

Speculation: Selene, Tasha, and the Catch 22
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-35" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>Implication from the conversation we overheard: Selene was put onto this trail by someone else. Perhaps Madame E, perhaps a chance conversation with a Secondhander on a mission, perhaps something arranged.</li>
<li>So, someone sent Tuhorn here.  Someone also sent Selene here. Tasha sent the Secondhand here.</li>
<li>Tasha needed a Watcher to discover this place. So a watcher was helping Tasha before Tasha was in the weeds.</li>
<li>The big question is the unclosed part of this catch 22. So Tasha needed a Watcher to start chasing this down. And we have &#34;Selene should know, she&#39;s told me so much&#34; from the journal.</li>
<li>So Selene was feeding Tasha info, this suggests somehow</li>
<li>So Tasha is the center of all this.</li>
<li>But Selene or Madame E is perhaps the prime mover</li>
<li>What set Tasha on the trail?</li>
<li>Who set Selene on the trail? Perhaps Tuhorn, perhaps Madame E?</li>
<li>Clues about Madame E have been thin on the ground. She&#39;s hiding and up to something, but what? Was she the prime mover in this?</li>
